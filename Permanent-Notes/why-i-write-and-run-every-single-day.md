> _“Energy is eternal delight.” — William Blake_

“It just feels good,” somebody might tell you. “It helps my mental health,” or “I can think more clearly.” People don’t just run because it is good for their physical body. People run because it can improve other parts of their life. Because it helps them feel better.

最初半小時，是為了我的身體；最後半小時，是為了我的靈魂。

越辛苦的事越值得細細品嚐；辛苦的生活才是我追求的生活。

人必須全力以赴。

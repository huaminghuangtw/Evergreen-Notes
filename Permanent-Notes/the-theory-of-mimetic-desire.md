# What is Mimetic Desire?

> We often want things just because other people have those things

René Girard’s theory suggests that our desires are not entirely our own—they are shaped by observing and imitating the desires of others (models). This process is often unconscious. We look to others to determine what is desirable, which can lead to competition, rivalry, and even conflict when multiple people want the same thing.

# Examples

* **Social Media Influence**: Trends, products, and lifestyles go viral because people see others wanting or having them, which triggers a [desire](the-absence-of-desire-is-true-happiness.md) to imitate.
* **Career Choices**: Many people pursue certain jobs or degrees because they see peers or role models doing so, not necessarily because of [intrinsic interest](be-primarily-internally-driven-with-intrinsic-motivation.md).
* **Consumer Behavior**: The popularity of certain brands or gadgets often stems from mimetic desire, not just utility.

我們的欲望通常不是源自內心深處，而是受到身邊他人的影響與模仿。我們渴望的事物，常常是他人也渴望的，例如交友方式、職業選擇、感情關係、穿搭品味等。若能將這些因「模仿」而生的欲望，轉化為有意識、符合自我價值的渴望，便能更清楚地選擇與經營最適合自己的生活方式。這樣一來，[獨特且真誠的個人特質](escape-competition-through-authenticity.md) 將逐漸形成，讓我們成為更有魅力、更具智慧的人。

# Thick vs Thin Desires

慾望分為兩種層次：

1. **Thick Desires（由內而外）**: Deeply held, intrinsic motivations. These are activities or goals you would pursue even if there were no external rewards or recognition. They are closely tied to your values and sense of purpose.
	* _Examples_: Creating art for personal fulfillment, helping others out of genuine compassion, pursuing a hobby you love regardless of status or money.
* **Thin Desires（由外而內）**: Surface-level, externally influenced wants. These are often adopted from others and may not bring lasting satisfaction.
	* _Examples_: Wanting a luxury car because it’s a status symbol, chasing a job title for prestige, following trends to fit in.

* Yes → Thick desires
* No → Thin desires

The tendency to look for answers where it's easiest, rather than where they're most likely to be found.

The illusion that truth lies under the brightest light, not in the shadows where it may truly dwell.

A cognitive bias driving us to search for solutions in the most accessible places, rather than in those where the truth actually lies.

Like searching for lost keys under a streetlight—not because they're there, but because the light is better.

> “Looking for my keys,” the man replies.
> ​
> “Did you lose them here?”
> ​
> “No, but this is where the light is.”

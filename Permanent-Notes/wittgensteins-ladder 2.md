is a concept from **Ludwig Wittgenstein’s** _Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_ (1921).

It refers to the idea that some propositions in philosophy are tools to help us understand **truths about the world**, but once their purpose is served, they should be **discarded**.

Wittgenstein writes:

> “My propositions serve as **steps** to **reach a higher understanding**; once one has climbed up them, one must **throw away the ladder**.”

The ladder metaphor highlights his belief that language can only **approximate reality**, and philosophical statements may be **meaningful only temporarily** to guide thought, not as ultimate truths themselves.

Once you achieve a certain level of understanding, you will realize those statements were a means to an end—and now that you’ve reached that end, you no longer need them.

Therefore, those statements should be discarded, like a ladder you’ve climbed and no longer need.

Essentially, **Wittgenstein’s Ladder** reminds us that some teachings or theories are **instruments for insight**, not final doctrines.

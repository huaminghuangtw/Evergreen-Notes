is a psychological phenomenon describing a tendency to remember _interrupted_ or _incomplete_ tasks or events more easily than tasks that have been _completed_

suggests that students who suspend their study to perform _unplanned energizing distractions [^1] / unrelated activities_ (such as _studying a different subject_ or _playing a game_), will remember material better than students who complete study sessions without a break

**The Power of Cliffhangers: Stop When You Know What Comes Next:**

* In practice, intentionally/strategically leaving certain pieces of your work/tasks/projects at a cliffhanger or an _incomplete/unfinished/unresolved_ point can boost your motivation and engagement when you resume.
* By leveraging and applying the Zeigarnik Effect, you can optimize productivity and make progress feel more seamless / make it easier to come back and dive into the flow during the next session.
	* This technique aids in…
		* maintaining continued forward momentum
		* enhancing natural curiosity and creativity by allowing your subconscious mind to work on the problem during breaks

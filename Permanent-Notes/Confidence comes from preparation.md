> _“Confidence comes from [preparation](planning-and-preparation-help-maximize-your-productivity.md). When the game is on the line, I’m not asking myself to do something I haven’t done a thousand times before…In those moments, if I look like ice-cold or not nervous, it’s because I’ve done it a thousand times before. So it’s (just) one more time.” — Kobe Bryant_

> _“Nothing wins more often than superior preparation. Genius is usually preparation.” — Kekich Credo_

> _[“You don’t become confident by shouting affirmations in the mirror, but by having a stack of undeniable proof that you are who you say you are.” — Alex Hormozi](https://x.com/AlexHormozi/status/1586441477952921600)_

> _[People are always claiming that success is a matter of luck, but as Pasteur pointed out, “Luck favors the prepared mind.” […] Many times a discussion with a person who has just done something important will produce a description of how they were led, almost step by step, to the result. It is usually based on things they had done, or intensely thought about, years ago. You succeed because you have prepared yourself with the necessary background long ago, without, of course, knowing then that it would prove to be a necessary step to success.” — Richard Hamming](https://www.mccurley.org/advice/hamming_advice.html)_

> _“The fight is won or lost far away from the witnesses, behind the lines, in the gym and out there on the road, long before I dance under those lights.” — Muhammad Ali_

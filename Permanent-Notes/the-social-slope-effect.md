一加一大於二

Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.

---

United we stand, divided we fall.

Challenges and struggles are inevitable, but facing them alone is optional.

In the first study, the researchers had a group of participants stand at the base of a steep 26° hill wearing a heavy backpack. Some of the participants were alone, while others were paired with a friend. Then they asked the participants to estimate the hill’s steepness.

The findings were fascinating:

* Participants who were paired with a friend estimated the hill to be significantly less steep than those who were alone.
* Relationship duration with the friend correlated negatively with perceived steepness. The longer the friendship, the gentler the hill appeared.

In a follow-up study, the researchers had the participants stand alone and simply imagine either a supportive person (friend), neutral person (store clerk), or negative person (someone who had betrayed them).

Once again, the results were clear:

* Participants who imagined a supportive person saw the hill as less steep than those who imagined neutral or negative people.
* The closeness and warmth of the imagined relationship were negatively correlated with perceived steepness. The better the relationship, the gentler the hill appeared.

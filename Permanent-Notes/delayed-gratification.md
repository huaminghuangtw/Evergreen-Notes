Caveat: Delay gratification in the extreme just results in no gratification. (or it’s called obsession)

---

The reason most people fail instead of succeed is they trade what they want most for [what they want at the moment](instant-gratification.md). Everything you want in life is on the other side of something that sucks.

* That suck might be 100 workouts.
* That suck might be 100 bland meals.
* That suck might be 100 hours of focused work.

Remember: Nothing worth having in life should be easy. The things that matter in life are supposed/meant to be hard/difficult to build. If it were easy, everyone would do it. That’s part of the journey toward growth and part of struggle/craft pushing through the discomfort. The best things in life require that upfront pain. Embrace the suck.

Every single thing you want in life comes at a cost. There is always a cost of entry (入場費). An unavoidable [price you must pay](Everything%20in%20life%20has%20an%20opportunity%20cost.md) to achieve the things you say you want.

1. Hard work is a cost of entry for business success.
2. Discipline is a cost of entry for physical health.
3. Practice is a cost of entry for skill mastery.

[Focus on your likes (long-term fulfillment), not your wants (short-term pleasure).](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/october-3-2024)

* You may not want to exercise, but you like how it makes you feel.
* You may not want to write, but you like the feeling of accomplishment.
* You may not want to wake up early, but you like the calm beauty of morning.

Remark: Wanting is the desire you feel before doing something. Liking is the satisfaction you feel after doing something. Let your likes guide you. The trick is to remember that [the joy comes not from the start, but from the finish](journey-over-destination.md).

# Convincing yourself and others to forgo instant gratification, often through <mark>strategic distraction</mark>.

[Delayed gratification isn’t about surrounding yourself with temptations and hoping to say no to them. No one is good at that. The smart way to handle long-term thinking is enjoying what you’re doing day to day enough that the terminal rewards don’t constantly cross your mind.](https://collabfund.com/blog/different-kinds-of-smart/)

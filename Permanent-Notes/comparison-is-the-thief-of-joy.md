比較 = 攀比

---

人比人，氣死人；蛋餅比蛋餅，起士蛋餅…

---

If you want to compare yourself with someone else, study ultra-successful people.

---

Compare yourself…

* to who you were _yesterday_ (past self), not to who someone else is _today_.
* against your personal benchmarks.

---

Stop comparing your day 1 to everyone else’s day 1000.

「社會就是地位的階梯，比較的結果決定處境。」— _The Broken Ladder (破階效應)_

---

Don’t follow the crowd. Run your own race. Free yourself from society’s advice, because most of them have no idea what they’re doing.

The best way to diminish your achievement is to compare it to someone else’s.

When you compare yourself with others, or have the desire to be like other people, you [start doing things that aren’t aligned with your true self, abandoning your awesome uniqueness](escape-competition-through-authenticity.md), and [engaging in a competitive zero-sum game](the-game-of-life.md).

Every ounce of energy you spend comparing yourself to others is an ounce that could have been spent on developing yourself.

The only time you should look in someone else’s bowl is to see if they have enough.

# 你與你的影子

1. 每個人面對的環境與際遇都不同，就像不同時間、不同角度的陽光，自然造成影子的長短不同，無法比較。
2. 陽光一移，影子就變。就像人生的不同階段，成就與低潮會交替。你現在的「短影子」，不代表你永遠渺小。
3. 影子是自己的一部分，無論它變成什麼形狀，仍然屬於你。和別人的影子比較，只會忘了自己本身的輪廓。真正該留意的，不是別人影子的樣子，而是你是否還在向著光走。
4. 影子永遠跟著你走，它提醒你：真正的比較對象，其實一直都是「昨天的自己」。

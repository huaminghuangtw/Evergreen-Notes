Goo design is…

1. **Innovative** — Design should explore new technologies and possibilities.
2. **Useful** — Products must fulfill a purpose and be functional.
3. **Aesthetic** — Good design is visually pleasing and appealing.
4. **Understandable** — Products should clearly communicate their function.
5. **Unobtrusive** — Design should be neutral and subtle, letting users focus on the product’s purpose.
6. **Honest** — Products shouldn’t try to appear more innovative or valuable than they are.
7. **Long-lasting** — Avoid trendy design; aim for durability in both function and style.
8. **Thorough down to the last detail** — Every element should be carefully considered.
9. **Environmentally friendly** — Minimize waste and consider sustainability.
10. ⭐️ **As little design as possible** — Removing anything unnecessary. Back to purity, back to [simplicity](simple-is-beautiful.md).

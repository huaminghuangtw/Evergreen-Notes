> _“What you deny subdues you. What you accept transforms you.” — Carl Jung_

> _“Compassion is not complete if it does not include oneself.” — Allan Lokos_

> _“Tension is who you think you should be. Relaxation is who you are.” — Buddha_

> _“Instead of shaming your emotions, try to understand what they are telling you.” — Lindsay C. Gibson_

> _“The truth is: Belonging starts with [self-acceptance](Acceptance%20and%20Commitment%20Therapy.md). Your level of belonging, in fact, can never be greater than your level of self-acceptance, because believing that you’re enough is what gives you the courage to be authentic, vulnerable and imperfect.” — Brene Brown_

> _“If your compassion does not include yourself, it is incomplete.” — Jack Kornfield_

> _“The goal is not to show how great you are to others, but how [vulnerable](vulnerability.md) you are to yourself.” — Maxime Lagace_

> _“As you gain fame, as you gain fortune, as you gain position and seniority, people will treat you better. — They will hold doors open for you. They will get you a cup of tea and coffee without you even asking. — None of that stuff is meant for you. That stuff is meant for the position you hold. It is meant to the level you have achieved of leader or success or whatever you want to call it, but remember: you will always deserve a Styrofoam cup.” — Simon Sinek_

> _“Harsh self-criticism activates the sympathetic nervous system (fight/flight) and elevates stress hormones. Self-compassion, on the other hand, triggers the mammalian caregiving system and hormones of affiliation and love such as oxytocin.” ― Marc Brackett, [Permission to Feel: The Power of Emotional Intelligence to Achieve Well-Being and Success](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/68114068)_

人生，就是要適時地放過自己。永遠要寬容、慈悲地對待自己。展現自我同情。

---

Being kind to others is mostly about your actions. Being kind to yourself is mostly about your thoughts.

---

接納自己的第一步是停止拿自己和別人比較。

> _“The first step to accepting yourself is to stop comparing yourself to others.” — Joe Duncan_

---

To embrace oneself fully, to understand our imperfections, to accept one’s truth, and still maintain the desire for growth and change, is to [live a fulfilling life](why-we-exist.md). Forgive yourself. You are a human, not a machine.

---

Embrace every aspect of yourself (your entirety), including strengths and weaknesses, rather than striving for an unattainable ideal of perfection. You are a perfectly imperfect person. You are whole in your own right. When you authentically manifest your deep presence in the world, every action becomes a natural expression of your truth. Truth is more than just honesty or the absence of lies. It is a deeper connection to who you truly are, an alignment with your soul. 💪

We just need to tweak the system rather than beating ourselves up.

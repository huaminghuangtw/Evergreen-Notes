> _“What you deny subdues you. What you accept transforms you.” — Carl Jung_

> _“Compassion is not complete if it does not include oneself.” — Allan Lokos_

> _“Tension is who you think you should be. Relaxation is who you are.” — Buddha_

> _“Instead of shaming your emotions, try to understand what they are telling you.” — Lindsay C. Gibson_

> _“The truth is: Belonging starts with [self-acceptance](Acceptance%20and%20Commitment%20Therapy.md). Your level of belonging, in fact, can never be greater than your level of self-acceptance, because believing that you're enough is what gives you the courage to be authentic, vulnerable and imperfect.” — Brene Brown_

> _“If your compassion does not include yourself, it is incomplete.” — Jack Kornfield_

人生，就是要適時地放過自己。永遠要寬容、慈悲地對待自己。展現自我同情。

---

Being kind to others is mostly about your actions. Being kind to yourself is mostly about your thoughts.

---

Treat yourself with respect.

---

To embrace oneself fully, to understand our imperfections, to accept one's truth, and still maintain the desire for growth and change, is to [live a fulfilling life](Why%20We%20Exist.md). Forgive yourself. You are a human, not a machine.

---

Embrace every aspect of yourself (your entirety), including strengths and weaknesses, rather than striving for an unattainable ideal of perfection. You are a perfectly imperfect person. You are whole in your own right. When you authentically manifest your deep presence in the world, every action becomes a natural expression of your truth. Truth is more than just honesty or the absence of lies. It is a deeper connection to who you truly are, an alignment with your soul. 💪

# The “Treat Yourself Like A robot” Mindset

We just need to tweak the system rather than beating ourselves up.

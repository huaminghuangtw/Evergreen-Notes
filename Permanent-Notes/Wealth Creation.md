Your true wealth is the quality of your [attention](attention.md). What you pay attention toâ€”expands.

You should only have to get rich once, and if you are going to swing for the fences, you still have to be sure that once you hit it, you will never bet it black again.

Wealth is not created by spending your time making money, but rather by saving your time to make money.

The Law of Effection

> Your wealth is directly related to the number of lives you impact and the value you provide. To become wealthy, solve significant problems or create value that affects many people.

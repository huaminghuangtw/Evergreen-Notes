= 如何問出精準 \& 精確的問題?

Questions are the answers.

* 問題問對了，好的答案自然會出現。

[A problem well-stated is a problem half-solved.](https://xyproblem.info/)

General questions are usually hard to answer. Instead, ask open, engaging, and follow-up questions (打蛇隨棍上).

* The more specific the question, the better the answer will be.

The beginner chases the right answer. The master chases the right questions.

* The stupidity of people comes from having an answer for everything. The wisdom of the novel comes from having a question for everything.

* Weave what you've learned into an informed question.
* Always include information about a broader picture along with any attempted solution.

**Socratic Questioning (The Socratic Method)** is a simple process of asking and answering questions that stimulate critical thinking to expose and vet underlying assumptions and logic.

[^1]: Avoid focusing on the attempted solution, rather than the actual problem. People don't want a faster horse. They want to get to their destination faster.

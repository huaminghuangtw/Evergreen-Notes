“One must never place a loaded rifle on the stage if it isn’t going to go off. It’s wrong to make promises you don’t mean to keep.”

* Every element in a story must be necessary, and if it’s not, it should be eliminated from the scene entirely.

# Structure is everything

* Basic
	* past → present → future
	* setup → tension → resolution
* Advanced
	* Dan Harmon’s story circle
	* Kurt Vonnegut’s story graphs
	* Gustav Freytag’s pyramid of storytelling

[^1]: Use more metaphors/analogy as linguistic tools to convey profound truths and complex ideas.

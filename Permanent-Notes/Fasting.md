Ghrelin (胃促生長素)

* “Hunger Hormone”
* The more ghrelin you produce, the more your stomach feels empty

Leptin (瘦體素)

* 飽足感荷爾蒙，可以降低食慾並增加飽足感
* The more leptin you produce, the less your stomach feels empty

胰妥讚（Ozempic），俗稱「瘦瘦筆」或「消脂針」，是一種每週注射一次的 GLP-1 類似物。它透過模擬腸泌素 GLP-1 的作用，促進胰島素分泌、抑制食慾、延緩胃排空，進而達到控制血糖與體重的效果。由於其顯著的減重成效，也被稱為「至今最有效的減重藥物」之一。[^1]

Eating and not eating are not equivalent to fed and fasted state—it depends on when you ate, how much you ate, and where you are in your circadian cycle.

How to determine if something breaks the fast?

Wear a continuous glucose monitor and inject little bits of food of different kinds, or large amounts of food of different kinds, and measure the blood glucose level.

# Different Types of Fasting
* Modified Therapeutic Fasting (such as Buchinger Fasting): involves consuming low-calorie liquids like juice and vegetable broth

[Combining intermittent-fasting regimens/paradigms, such as *early or midday time-restricted feeding* with a healthier diet during the feeding windows, may prove to be particularly powerful.](https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fasting/)

* Prefer _early TRF_ (eTRF, food intake restricted to the early part of the day) [^2] over _mid-day TRF_ (mTRF, food intake restricted to the middle of the day) [@xieRandomizedControlledTrial2022]
	* eTRF was more effective than mTRF at improving insulin sensitivity.
	* eTRF improved fasting glucose, reduced total body mass and adiposity, ameliorated inflammation, and increased gut microbial diversity.
* [If you want to skip a meal, skip supper, not breakfast. Breatkfast is called “break fast” for a reason.](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ByqWE1TbYWc)

# Negative Visualization (= Mental Contrasting = Fantasy Realization Theory)

* Seems to be particularly effective when it is combined with “[Implementation Intentions](implementation-intentions.md)”
* The WOOP Framework
	1. Consider your Wish
	2. Imagine the Outcome
	3. Identify the Obstacle
	4. Make a Plan
* Engaging first in the “positive fantasy (daydreams)” followed by an acknowledgement of the “negative reality”.
* Visualize the negativities (e.g., disappointment, regret, pity, etc.) if you fail to achieve your goal, rather than simply visualize the goal you want to achieve — Rather than focus on the actions required for success. Consider what would lead to failure and avoid it.
* Harnessing the power of _anticipated regret_, which involves envisioning the potential disappointment you’ll feel in the future if you don’t take certain actions today, can guide you to [make decisions](decision-making.md) that your future self will truly appreciate.

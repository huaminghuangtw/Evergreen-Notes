> _“Emotion arises at the place where mind & body meet. It is the body’s reaction to mind.” — Eckhart Tolle_

> _“We as a culture seem to be dedicated to the idea that ‘negative’ human emotions need to be fixed, managed, or changed—not experienced as part of a whole life. We are treating our own lives as problems to be solved as if we can sort through our experiences for the ones we like and throw out the rest.” — Steven C. Hayes_

Instead of avoiding, denying, or battling your [negative thoughts and emotions](What%20to%20do%20when%20you%20have%20negative%20thoughts%20or%20emotions.md), ACT encourages people to face them with [openness](be-ready-to-change-your-mind-completely-at-any-given-time.md)—_**accepting**_ that these deeper feelings are natural and appropriate responses to certain situations, rather than reasons to avoid them. By embracing this perspective, you begin to accept your challenges and focus on committing to meaningful changes in your behavior.

Imagine you’re scheduled to give a presentation at work. You might think, “_I’m nervous, and I’m going to mess it up._” Feeling nervous before a presentation is a realistic expectation to have. ACT can help you [reframe your thoughts](a-true-transformation-begins-with-a-mental-shift.md) to: “_I know I feel nervous, and that’s OK. I’m going to practice giving my presentation before the meeting so I feel more confident._”

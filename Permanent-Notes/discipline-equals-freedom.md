> _「只有在生活中紀律嚴明的人才是自由的。如果缺乏紀律，只會成為情緒和激情的奴隸。」(Only the disciplined ones in life are free. If you are undisciplined, you are a slave to your moods and your passions.) — Eliud Kipchoge_

Discipline is about what you do on the days when you feel like crap.

---

Discipline is the highest form of [self-love](Self-compassion.md). It’s choosing short-term pain over long-term gain. Its loving yourself enough to not trade what you want most for what you want now.

---

Discipline is like being a wise parent to your inner child. The more disciplined you are, the more freedom your inner child has to explore and thrive.

「自律」只是外在的表面結果，「自願」才是內在真正的驅動力。

Discipline now, freedom later. [Discipline equals freedom.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23848190-extreme-ownership) You have to sacrifice short-term freedom in order to earn long-term freedom. Sacrifice is the cost of entry. [Delayed gratification](Delayed%20Gratification.md) is the key to building the life you want.

Excellence translates across disciplines.

Winners are not people who never _fail_, but people who never _quit_. Remember: “_If you quit now, you will soon be back to where you started. And when you started, you will be desperately wishing to be where you are right now._”

世界上最難的管理，是自我管理；世界上最難的領導，是領導自己。

# The One-second Decision By David Goggins

> _When you are doing something hard in life, you are making a second by second decision to keep going. If you lose one of those seconds, you’ve lost. Each second is an opportunity to keep going or to quit._

# Design Your Environment Carefully

[Think about self-control less as the quality of a person and more as the quality of a place. There are some places and situations that lean toward lower self-control and others that lean toward higher self-control. Self-control is about your context as much as your character. Put yourself in good positions.](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/february-27-2025)

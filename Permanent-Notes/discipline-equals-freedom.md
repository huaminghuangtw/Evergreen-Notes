> _[“Discipline is doing what you hate to do, but nonetheless doing it like you love it.” — Mike Tyson](https://x.com/MikeTyson/status/1051925919710027777)_

> _「只有在生活中紀律嚴明的人才是自由的。如果缺乏紀律，只會成為情緒和激情的奴隸。」(Only the disciplined ones in life are free. If you are undisciplined, you are a slave to your moods and your passions.) — Eliud Kipchoge_

> _“A vital part of the happiness formula is self-discipline. Whoever conquers himself knows deep happiness that fills the heart with joy.” — Norman Vincent Peale_

# 康德（Immanuel Kant）：自律即自由

> _“Autonomie des Willens ist die Eigenschaft des Willens, sich selbst ein Gesetz zu sein.” — Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten, BA 89_
>
> 「意志的自律，就是意志為自己立法的能力。」

> _“Freiheit ist die Eigenschaft, eine Ursache unabhängig von fremden, bestimmenden Ursachen zu sein.” — Kritik der praktischen Vernunft_
>
> 「自由，就是作為一個原因而不受其他外在決定性原因所支配的性質。」

> _“Ein Will ist nur dann frei, wenn er autonom ist.”_
>
> 「意志唯有在自律時才是自由的。」

* 真正的道德行為不是因外在獎賞或懲罰，而是出於內在的理性命令（定言命令）。
* 對康德而言，自由 = 自主地依理性立法（自律）行動，而非被外在欲望或他人驅動。
* 一個人只有在自律時，才擁有道德上的自由。

Discipline is about what you do on the days when you feel like crap.

---

Discipline is the highest form of [self-love](self-compassion.md). It’s choosing short-term pain over long-term gain. Its loving yourself enough to not trade what you want most for what you want now.

---

Discipline is like being a wise parent to your inner child. The more disciplined you are, the more freedom your inner child has to explore and thrive.

---

「自律」只是外在的表面結果，「自願」才是內在真正的驅動力。

---

Discipline now, freedom later. [Discipline equals freedom.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23848190-extreme-ownership) You have to sacrifice short-term freedom in order to earn long-term freedom. Sacrifice is the cost of entry (入場費). [Delayed gratification](delayed-gratification.md) is the key to building the life you want.

[Screw motivation, what you need is discipline.](https://www.wisdomination.com/screw-motivation-what-you-need-is-discipline/) Discipline eats motivation for breakfast.

---

Excellence translates across disciplines.

---

Winners are not people who never _fail_, but people who never _quit_. Remember: “_If you quit now, you will soon be back to where you started. And when you started, you will be desperately wishing to be where you are right now._”

---

世界上最難的管理，是自我管理；世界上最難的領導，是領導自己。

# The One-second Decision By David Goggins

> _When you are doing something hard in life, you are making a second by second decision to keep going. If you lose one of those seconds, you’ve lost. Each second is an opportunity to keep going or to quit._

# Design Your Environment Carefully

[Think about self-control less as the quality of a person and more as the quality of a place. There are some places and situations that lean toward lower self-control and others that lean toward higher self-control. Self-control is about your context as much as your character. Put yourself in good positions.](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/february-27-2025)

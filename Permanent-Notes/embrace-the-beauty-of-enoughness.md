“If I get [X], then I’ll be happy.” is a dangerous trap/mirage/fallacy.

If you’re not enough without [X], you’ll never be enough with [X].

[Things in excess become their opposite.](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9512978-things-in-excess-become-their-opposite-it-is-possible-to) [^2]

The dose makes the poison. Some things are beneficial in small amounts but become harmful in excess—such as free time, intensity, and stress. The key is to find the optimal dose, which is unique to you and will evolve through different seasons of your life. Never accept someone else’s prescribed dose as your own.

For everything in life, the answer always lies somewhere in the middle. Beyond a certain point, any additional amount can lead to diminishing or even negative returns. Be careful listening to extremists of either side. Too much of anything is harmful.

Keys:

* Set boundaries
* Find/Maintain balance/sweet spot（甜蜜點）/trade-off

Notice:

* Peak/Inflection Point = Point of [Diminishing Returns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns) = Point of Maximum Yield = Marginal Utility
* Costs/Benefits Ratio

More isn’t always better.

Moderation/Harmony is key. Enough is enough.

# 五月天《知足》

> 怎麼去擁有一道彩虹？
> 怎麼去擁抱 一夏天的風？
> 天上的星星笑地上的人
> 總是不能懂 不能覺得足夠
> 如果我愛上你的笑容
> 要怎麼收藏？要怎麼擁有？
> 如果你快樂不是為我
> 會不會放手 其實才是擁有
> 當一陣風吹來 風箏飛上天空
> 為了你而祈禱 而祝福 而感動
> 終於你身影消失在人海盡頭
> 才發現笑著哭最痛
> 那天你和我 那個山丘
> 那樣的唱著 那一年的歌
> 那樣的回憶 那麼足夠
> 足夠我天天 都品嚐著寂寞
> 當一陣風吹來 風箏飛上天空
> 為了你而祈禱 而祝福 而感動
> 終於你身影消失在人海盡頭
> 才發現笑著哭最痛
> 當一陣風吹來 風箏飛上天空
> 為了你而祈禱 而祝福 而感動
> 終於你身影消失在人海盡頭
> 才發現笑著哭最痛
> 如果我愛上你的笑容
> 要怎麼收藏？要怎麼擁有？
> 如果你快樂再不是為我
> 會不會放手 其實才是擁有
> 知足的快樂 叫我忍受心痛
> 知足的快樂 叫我忍受心痛

* 無法擁有的事物：歌詞中以彩虹、夏天的風、星空等意象，比喻那些美好卻無法被個人擁有、稍縱即逝的美好事物，如愛情中的美好伴侶。
* 放手是擁有：就如同將一陣風箏放飛，選擇放手並祝福對方，才能真正擁有美好回憶。雖然帶有心痛，但這份理智的決定，也讓美好的情感得以昇華，在心中留下珍貴的回憶。
* 回憶的永恆：在對方身影消失後，過往的山丘、歌曲、還有曾經陪伴的人事物，這些美好的回憶片段已足夠填滿日後的生活，讓人感到滿足。
* 知足的快樂：理解到有些事物終究不屬於自己，學會放下，並細細品嚐不捨、失去、心痛的滋味，就是一種「知足的快樂」。

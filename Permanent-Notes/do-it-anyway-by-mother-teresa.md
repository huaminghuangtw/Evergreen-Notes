People are often unreasonable, illogical, and self-centered. **Forgive them anyway.**

If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish ulterior motives. **Be kind anyway.**

If you are successful, you will win some false friends and some true enemies. **Succeed anyway.**

If you are honest and frank, people may cheat you. **Be honest and frank anyway.**

What you spend years building, someone could destroy overnight. **Build anyway.**

If you find serenity and happiness, they may be jealous. **Be happy anyway.**

The good you do today, people will often forget tomorrow. **Do good anyway.**

Give the world the best you have, and it may never be enough. **Give the best you’ve got anyway.**

You see, **in the final analysis it is between you and God; it was never between you and them anyway.**

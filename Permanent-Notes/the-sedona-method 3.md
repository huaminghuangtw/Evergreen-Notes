= 瑟多納釋放法

# 1. Identify the issue.

Bring to mind a specific feeling, thought, or problem.

> “What am I feeling right now?”

Don’t analyze it — just notice the raw sensation.

# 2. Allow the feeling to be present.

Welcome it instead of resisting it.

> “Could I allow this feeling to simply be here?”

The goal is openness, not suppression.

# 3. Ask: “Could I let this go?”

This invites the possibility of releasing the emotion.

Don’t force it. Any answer — yes, no, not sure — is fine.

# 4. Ask: “Would I let it go?”

This checks willingness.

If the answer is no, you can ask “Would I rather hold on to this?”

Again, no pressure.

# 5. Ask: “When?”

This moves the release into the present moment.

The intended answer is “Now” — but it’s okay if it isn’t.

Simply choose whether to let it go.

**You can repeat the cycle as needed until the emotional charge softens or dissolves.**

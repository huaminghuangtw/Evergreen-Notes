# Two Types of Fear

* <u>The Fear of Failure</u>: The fear that you will go after something and it won’t work out. That everyone will know that you failed. That you will know that you failed.
* <u>The Fear of Success</u>: The fear that you will accomplish everything you set out to achieve and never be able to live up to it again. The fear that everything will work out and you won’t be deserving of that end. That you won’t be ready for what comes from it.

# Success > Failure > Not Trying At All

> _[“Do not fear failure but rather fear not trying.” — Roy T. Bennett, The Light in the Heart](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8131554-do-not-fear-failure-but-rather-fear-not-trying)_

> _“Don’t be afraid to fail. Be afraid not to try.” — Michael Jordan_

> _“Try and fail, but don’t fail to try.” — Stephen Kaggwa_

Sometimes I refuse to [give 100% effort](always-do-your-best-as-possible.md) towards something because I’m scared of what will happen if I do give 100% effort and still fail. But that **self-protection mechanism** is a growth limiter. When you insulate yourself from the pain of failure, you never really learn what you’re capable of. You never really put yourself out there on the edge and stare down the abyss.

The failure itself isn’t what scares you. The anticipation of failure isn’t what prevents you from taking action. The fear isn’t as it seems.

You aren’t afraid of failure. You’re afraid of what other people will think of you if you fail.

The fear is in the judgment. The fear is in the embarrassment. The fear is in the scrutiny. The fear is in the whispers. The fear is in what they might say, or what they might think. The fear is in the silence.

> _“We fear our highest possibilities. We are generally afraid to become that which we can glimpse in our most perfect moments, under the most perfect conditions, under conditions of great courage. We enjoy and even thrill to the godlike possibilities we see in ourselves in such peak moments. And yet we simultaneously shiver with weakness, awe, and fear before these very same possibilities. So often, we run away from the responsibilities dictated, or rather suggested by nature, by fate, even sometimes by accident, just as [Jonah](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jonah%201-3&version=NIV) tried in vain to run away from his fate.” — Abraham H. Maslow, [The Farther Reaches of Human Nature](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/486580)_

> _“Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, ‘Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?’ Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It’s not just in some of us; it’s in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.” — Marianne Williamson, [A Return to Love: Reflections on the Principles of “A Course in Miracles”](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/928-our-deepest-fear-is-not-that-we-are-inadequate-our)_ [^1]

> _“Owning our story and loving ourselves through that process is the bravest thing that we’ll ever do.” — Brené Brown_

> _“We fear discovering that we are more than we think we are. More than our parents/children/teachers think we are. We fear that we actually possess the talent that our still, small voice tells us. That we actually have the guts, the perseverance, the capacity. We fear that we truly can steer our ship, plant our flag, reach our Promised Land. We fear this because, if it’s true, then we become estranged from all we know. We pass through a membrane. We become monsters and monstrous.” ― Steven Pressfield, [The War of Art](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/722104)_

> _“Joy can only be real if people look upon their life as a service and have a definite object in life outside themselves and their personal happiness.” — Leo Tolstoy_

> *“You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.” — Albert Camus

> _“Don’t ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you come alive, and go do that, because what the world needs is people who have come alive.” — Howard Thurman_

[@niebuhrIronyAmericanHistory2010]

> _“Nothing that is worth doing can be achieved in our lifetime; therefore we must be saved by hope. Nothing which is true or beautiful or good makes complete sense in any immediate context of history; therefore we must be saved by faith. Nothing we do, however virtuous, can be accomplished alone; therefore we must be saved by love. No virtuous act is quite as virtuous from the standpoint of our friend or foe as it is from our standpoint. Therefore we must be saved by the final form of love which is forgiveness.”_

[@pressfieldWarArtBreak2003]

> _“None of us are born as passive generic blobs waiting for the world to stamp its imprint on us. Instead we show up possessing already a highly refined and individuated soul. Another way of thinking of it is: We’re not born with unlimited choices. We can’t be anything we want to be. We come into this world with a specific, personal destiny. We have a job to do, a calling to enact, a self to become. We are who we are from the cradle, and we’re stuck with it. **Our job in this lifetime is not to shape ourselves into some ideal we imagine we ought to be, but to find out who we already are and become it.**” ― Steven Pressfield, [The War of Art](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/722104)_

> _“It’s more important to be good ancestors than dutiful descendants. Too many people spend their lives being custodians of the past instead of stewards of the future. We worry about making our parents proud when we should be focused on making our children proud. The responsibility of each generation is not to please our predecessors—it’s to improve conditions for our successors.” ― Adam M. Grant, [Hidden Potential: The Science of Achieving Greater Things](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/170223349)_

[Missions are infinite. Goals are finite.](https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/the-life-changing-power-of-missions)

* You _never reach_ a Mission, you _live out_ a Mission.
* Missions are life [journey](journey-over-destination.md), [with no specific ends](The%20Game%20of%20Life.md).
* Missions are _directions/scope_ of life, not the _destination_ of life.
* Mission statements usually (and should) sound like vague platitudes.
* [Goals](goal-setting.md) are focused around discrete achievements, [with specific ends](The%20Game%20of%20Life.md).

Leo Tolstoy emphasizes the importance of viewing life as a service with a purpose beyond personal happiness. He suggests that joy emerges when individuals dedicate themselves to something larger than their own self-interest.

Albert Camus argues that seeking a singular meaning of life can hinder truly living. His existential perspective implies that life itself is an ongoing journey without an ultimate destination or fixed meaning. Camus encourages embracing the present and finding significance in everyday experiences rather than searching for an overarching purpose.

> _“The best way to overcome the fear of death — so at least it seems to me — is to make your interests gradually wider and more impersonal, until bit by bit the walls of the ego recede, and your life becomes increasingly merged in the universal life.” — Bertrand Russell_

* ⭐️ Not to find the meaning of life, but to use your life to create things that are meaningful.
* Find something much bigger and more important than you are, and dedicate your life to it. [^2]
* Fulfillment is found through connection to something greater than the self.
* The 3 Big Questions
	* **The “1 Thing” Question:** If you had to boil life down to one truth or philosophy that makes life valuable, what is it?
	* **The “Being” Question:** How does that 1 Thing impact your being? In other words, how does it shape the core of who you are and your character?
	* **The “Doing” Question:** How does that 1 Thing impact your doing? In other words, how does it shape what you do with your life?

我們每個人對於已經存在 137 億年的宇宙而言，都是倏忽/轉瞬即逝的存在。任何人世間的紛爭/擾，放在已經存在 137 億年的宇宙旁邊，都是那麼地微不足道。在人生這段旅程中，沒有一樣東西能永久留下，它們終將淡去消失、煙灰雲散，不會有任何聲響。

* The great use of life is to spend it for something that outlasts it. To be remembered by people is to live forever.
* _The sad part is, that I will probably end up loving you without you for much longer than I loved you when I knew you. Some people might find that strange. But the truth of it is that the amount of love you feel for someone and the impact they have on you as a person, is in no way relative to the amount of time you have known them.” — Ranata Suzuki_
* _[“To live in hearts we leave behind is not to die.” — Thomas Campbell](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8204-to-live-in-hearts-we-leave-behind-is-not-to)_
* _[“Your biological age is the number of days you've lived. Your psychological age is the number of thoughts you've entertained. Your sociological age is the number of contributions you've made.” — James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/december-12-2024)_
* _“(It’s true that) none of us will get to live forever(, but) none of the people who die are gone. They’re with us every day. I once heard a pastor at a church say that they’re like ships sailing out of the harbor. Yes, at some point, as they get past the horizon, we can’t see them anymore. But that doesn’t mean they’re gone. I don’t think we ever lose the people who pass away. They stay with us every day, in our memories, but also in the way they shaped our lives.” — Arnold Schwarzenegger_
* _“No one is finally dead until the ripples they cause in the world die away, until the clock wound up winds down, until the wine she made has finished its ferment, until the crop they planted is harvested. The span of someone’s life is only the core of their actual existence.” — Terry Pratchett, Reaper Man_

In April of 1958, Hunter S. Thompson was 22 years old when he wrote a letter (found in [Letters of Note](https://fantastic-ounce-694.notion.site/Hunter-S-Thompson-on-Finding-Your-Life-Purpose-beca85a66c624275b80ffb4faae2b44c)) to his friend Hume Logan in response to a request for life advice:

> April 22, 1958
> 57 Perry Street
> New York City
>
> Dear Hume,
>
> You ask advice: ah, what a very human and very dangerous thing to do! For to give advice to a man who asks what to do with his life implies something very close to egomania. To presume to point a man to the right and ultimate goal— to point with a trembling finger in the RIGHT direction is something only a fool would take upon himself.
>
> I am not a fool, but I respect your sincerity in asking my advice. I ask you though, in listening to what I say, to remember that all advice can only be a product of the man who gives it. _What is truth to one may be disaster to another._ I do not see life through your eyes, nor you through mine. _If I were to attempt to give you specific advice, it would be too much like the blind leading the blind._
>
> “To be, or not to be: that is the question: Whether ‘tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles … ” (Shakespeare)
>
> And indeed, that IS the question: whether to float with the tide, or to swim for a goal. It is a choice we must all make consciously or unconsciously at one time in our lives. So few people understand this! Think of any decision you’ve ever made which had a bearing on your future: I may be wrong, but I don’t see how it could have been anything but a choice however indirect— between the two things I’ve mentioned: the floating or the swimming.
>
> But _why not float if you have no goal?_ That is another question. _It is unquestionably better to enjoy the floating than to swim in uncertainty._ So how does a man find a goal? Not a castle in the stars, but a real and tangible thing. How can a man be sure he’s not after the “big rock candy mountain,” the enticing sugar-candy goal that has little taste and no substance?
>
> The answer—and, in a sense, the tragedy of life— is that we seek to understand the goal and not the man. We set up a goal which demands of us certain things: and we do these things. We adjust to the demands of a concept which CANNOT be valid. When you were young, let us say that you wanted to be a fireman. I feel reasonably safe in saying that you no longer want to be a fireman. Why? Because your perspective has changed. It’s not the fireman who has changed, but you. _Every man is the sum total of his reactions to experience._ As your experiences differ and multiply, you become a different man, and hence your perspective changes. This goes on and on. _Every reaction is a learning process; every significant experience alters your perspective._
>
> So it would seem foolish, would it not, to adjust our lives to the demands of a goal we see from a different angle every day? How could we ever hope to accomplish anything other than galloping neurosis?
>
> The answer, then, must not deal with goals at all, or not with tangible goals, anyway. It would take reams of paper to develop this subject to fulfillment. God only knows how many books have been written on “the meaning of man” and that sort of thing, and god only knows how many people have pondered the subject. (I use the term “god only knows” purely as an expression.) There’s very little sense in my trying to give it up to you in the proverbial nutshell, because I’m the first to admit my absolute lack of qualifications for reducing the meaning of life to one or two paragraphs.
>
> I’m going to steer clear of the word “existentialism,” but you might keep it in mind as a key of sorts. You might also try something called Being and Nothingness by Jean-Paul Sartre, and another little thing called Existentialism: From Dostoyevsky to Sartre. These are merely suggestions. If you’re genuinely satisfied with what you are and what you’re doing, then give those books a wide berth. (Let sleeping dogs lie.) But back to the answer. As I said, to put our faith in tangible goals would seem to be, at best, unwise. So we do not strive to be firemen, we do not strive to be bankers, nor policemen, nor doctors. _WE STRIVE TO BE OURSELVES._
>
> But don’t misunderstand me. I don’t mean that we can’t BE firemen, bankers, or doctors— but that _we must make the goal conform to the individual, rather than make the individual conform to the goal._ In every man, heredity and environment have combined to produce a creature of certain abilities and desires— including a deeply ingrained need to function in such a way that his life will be MEANINGFUL. A man has to BE something; he has to matter.
>
> As I see it then, the formula runs something like this: a man must choose a path which will let his ABILITIES function at maximum efficiency toward the gratification of his DESIRES. In doing this, he is fulfilling a need (giving himself identity by functioning in a set pattern toward a set goal), he avoids frustrating his potential (choosing a path which puts no limit on his self-development), and he avoids the terror of seeing his goal wilt or lose its charm as he draws closer to it (rather than bending himself to meet the demands of that which he seeks, he has bent his goal to conform to his own abilities and desires).
>
> In short, he has not dedicated his life to reaching a pre-defined goal, but he has rather chosen a way of life he KNOWS he will enjoy. The goal is absolutely secondary: it is the functioning toward the goal which is important. And it seems almost ridiculous to say that a man MUST function in a pattern of his own choosing; for to let another man define your own goals is to give up one of the most meaningful aspects of life—the definitive act of will which makes a man an individual.
>
> Let’s assume that _you think you have a choice of eight paths to follow_ (all pre-defined paths, of course). And _let’s assume that you can’t see any real purpose in any of the eight._ THEN— and here is the essence of all I’ve said— _you MUST FIND A NINTH PATH._
>
> Naturally, it isn’t as easy as it sounds. You’ve lived a relatively narrow life, a vertical rather than a horizontal existence. So it isn’t any too difficult to understand why you seem to feel the way you do. But a man who procrastinates in his CHOOSING will inevitably have his choice made for him by circumstance.
>
> So if you now number yourself among the disenchanted, then you have no choice but to accept things as they are, or to seriously seek something else. But _beware of looking for goals: look for a way of life._ Decide how you want to live and then see what you can do to make a living WITHIN that way of life. But you say, “I don’t know where to look; I don’t know what to look for.”
>
> And there’s the crux. Is it worth giving up what I have to look for something better? I don’t know—is it? Who can make that decision but you? But even by DECIDING TO LOOK, you go a long way toward making the choice.
>
> If I don’t call this to a halt, I’m going to find myself writing a book. I hope it’s not as confusing as it looks at first glance. Keep in mind, of course, that this is MY WAY of looking at things. I happen to think that it’s pretty generally applicable, but you may not. Each of us has to create our own credo—this merely happens to be mine.
>
> If any part of it doesn’t seem to make sense, by all means call it to my attention. I’m not trying to send you out “on the road” in search of Valhalla, but merely pointing out that _it is not necessary to accept the choices handed down to you by life as you know it._ There is more to it than that—_no one HAS to do something he doesn’t want to do for the rest of his life. But then again, if that’s what you wind up doing, by all means convince yourself that you HAD to do it. You’ll have lots of company._
>
> And that’s it for now. Until I hear from you again, I remain,
>
> your friend,
> Hunter

The **S.H.A.P.E. Assessment** is a self-discovery tool used primarily in Christian contexts to help individuals understand how God has uniquely designed them for service, purpose, and contribution within the church and broader community. The acronym **S.H.A.P.E.** stands for **Spiritual Gifts, Heart, Abilities, Personality,** and **Experiences**, offering a framework to discern one’s unique qualities, passions, and strengths. By reflecting on these five areas, individuals can identify their God-given purpose and discover how they can best serve others meaningfully and effectively.

| **Letter** | **Stands for**      | **Meaning**                                                                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **S**      | **Spiritual Gifts** | What spiritual gifts or talents has God given you? (e.g., teaching, mercy, leadership)      |
| **H**      | **Heart**           | What are you passionate about? What causes or activities deeply move you?                   |
| **A**      | **Abilities**       | What natural talents, skills, or learned competencies do you have?                          |
| **P**      | **Personality**     | How do you interact with others? Are you introverted, extroverted, structured, spontaneous? |
| **E**      | **Experiences**     | What life experiences (good and bad) have shaped who you are today?                         |

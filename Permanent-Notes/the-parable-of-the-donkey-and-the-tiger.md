> One day, a Donkey and a Tiger got into an argument over the color of the grass.
> ​
> “The grass is blue,” said the Donkey.
> ​
> “That’s ridiculous,” replied the Tiger. “The grass is clearly green.”
> ​
> When the argument grew more and more intense, they decided to find the Lion, King of the Jungle, to settle the debate.
> ​
> When they approached the Lion, the Donkey exclaimed, “Your Highness, isn’t it true that the grass is blue?”
> ​
> “Yes,” the Lion calmly answered, “The grass is blue.”
> ​
> Not yet satisfied, the Donkey continued, “The Tiger disagrees and argues with me. You must punish him.”
> ​
> The Lion nodded, “I will. The Tiger will be punished with a year of silence.”
> ​
> The Donkey walked off into the jungle, celebrating his victory.
> ​
> Before the Tiger turned to leave, he looked up at the Lion. “Your Highness, why have you punished me? After all, you must see the grass is clearly green.”
> ​
> The Lion nodded, “Yes, of course the grass is green.”
> ​
> “Then why am I being punished?” asked the Tiger.
> ​
> <mark>“Because someone as wise as you should never waste time proving anything to a fool.”</mark>

The Pickle Jar Theory is a [time management](time-management.md) technique that prioritizes tasks based on importance, using the analogy of fitting different-sized items (**rocks/boulders**, **pebbles**, and **sand**) into a jar to represent one’s daily schedule or time available.

The idea is to start with the most important tasks / fill the jar with the biggest rock/boulders first, followed by medium-priority tasks (pebbles), and finally, less important tasks (sand).

This method helps to maximize time and ensure that the most important items are addressed first, preventing them from being overshadowed by less critical activities.

**Think of your time as a jar. If you don’t make space for the big rocks, the little pebbles and tiny sand will fill your whole jar. And you’ll always wonder why you’re not getting anything meaningful done.**

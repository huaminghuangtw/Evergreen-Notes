* **Step 1** - Ask yourself: is it really true? Like, is it _really_ true? Have you really got incontrovertible evidence to support this? Could there be no other way of interpreting the data other than the belief?
* **Step 2** - How does this belief make you feel? What thoughts or behaviors does it lead to?
* **Step 3** - Imagine a world in which this belief didn’t exist in your mind. You’ve never even entertained the thought of the belief. How do you feel in this situation? What thoughts or behaviours does this new state lead to?
* **Step 4** - Consider the _opposite_ of the belief. Come up with 3 reasons why the _opposite_ is true.

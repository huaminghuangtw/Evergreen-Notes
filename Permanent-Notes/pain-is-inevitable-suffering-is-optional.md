> “The struggles you endure today will be the ‘good old days’ you’ll laugh about tomorrow.” — Aaron Lauritsen

> “Don’t let your imagination be crushed by life as a whole. Don’t try to picture everything bad that could possibly happen. Stick with the situation at hand, and ask, “Why is this so unbearable? Why can’t I endure it?”

> “Pain is neither unbearable nor unending, as long as you keep in mind its limits and don’t magnify them in your imagination.”

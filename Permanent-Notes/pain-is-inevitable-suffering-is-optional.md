> _“Don’t let your imagination be crushed by life as a whole. Don’t try to picture everything bad that could possibly happen. Stick with the situation at hand, and ask, “Why is this so unbearable? Why can’t I endure it?”_

> _“Pain is neither unbearable nor unending, as long as you keep in mind its limits and don’t magnify them in your imagination.” _

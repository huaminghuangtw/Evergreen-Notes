School lays the foundation, but true education starts when you step beyond the classroom.

# [Learning is a lifelong process.](https://hbr.org/2017/02/lifelong-learning-is-good-for-your-health-your-wallet-and-your-social-life)

凡是沒有在持續學習的人，精神上早已死去 — 只有死人才不學習。

真正的終身學習者，無論活到幾歲，大腦總是為「未知」留下一席之地，因此他們永遠年輕。

那些自稱「沒時間學習」的人，其實是選擇像機器人一樣操作眼前的生活。

有些人活著，卻如同行屍走肉，因為他們從不思考；有些人死了，卻永遠活著，因為他們的思想永存。

# 當知道的越多，就會發現不知道的也越多

讀書若不思考，只會讓你自以為知道很多；讀書並深思，才會讓你清楚自己所知有限。

> [“The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.” — Socrates](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9431-the-only-true-wisdom-is-in-knowing-you-know-nothing)

> “Real knowledge is to know the extent of one’s ignorance.” [^1] — Confucius [^2] [^3]

> “The fool who knows he is a fool is that much wiser. The fool who thinks himself wise is a fool indeed.” — Buddhism

> “We are all born ignorant, but one must work hard to remain stupid.” — Benjamin Franklin

* The more you know, the more you realize you don’t know.
* The more I learn, the less I feel I know.
* The more you learn, the more you are exposed to the immense unknown.
* Experts are only aware of what they don’t know.

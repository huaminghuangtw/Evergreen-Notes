Caveat: Delay gratification in the extreme just results in no gratification. (or it's called obsession)

The reason most people fail instead of succeed is they trade what they want most for [what they want at the moment](instant-gratification.md). Everything you want in life is on the other side of something that sucks.

* That suck might be 100 workouts.
* That suck might be 100 bland meals.
* That suck might be 100 hours of focused work.

Remember: Nothing worth having in life should be easy. The things that matter in life are supposed/meant to be hard/difficult to build. If it were easy, everyone would do it. That's part of the journey toward growth and part of struggle/craft pushing through the discomfort. The best things in life require that upfront pain. Embrace the suck.

[Focus on your likes (long-term fulfillment), not your wants (short-term pleasure).](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/october-3-2024)

* You may not want to exercise, but you like how it makes you feel.
* You may not want to write, but you like the feeling of accomplishment.
* You may not want to wake up early, but you like the calm beauty of morning.

Remark: Wanting is the desire you feel before doing something. Liking is the satisfaction you feel after doing something. Let your likes guide you. The trick is to remember that [the joy comes not from the start, but from the finish](Journey%20over%20destination.md).

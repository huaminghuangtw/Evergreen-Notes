> “Do not seek for things to happen as you wish, but wish for things to happen as they do happen, and your life will flow well.” — Epictetus

> “My formula for greatness in a human being is Amor Fati: that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it…but love it.” — Friedrich Nietzsche

It’s a Latin phrase that translates to “love of (one’s) fate.”

It’s a daily reminder that peace, happiness, and fulfillment _aren’t found in resisting the river, but in flowing with it._

It’s the idea and practice of embracing everything that life throws at you—the good and the bad, the calm and [the chaos](life-is-chaotic.md).

**Embrace what lies beyond your control—and [act on that which is within it.](control-the-controllable.md)**

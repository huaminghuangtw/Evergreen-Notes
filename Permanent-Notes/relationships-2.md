# General

* [Dr. Robert Waldinger](https://www.robertwaldinger.com/) [^1]
	* [Relationship satisfaction at age 50 was the single greatest predictor of physical health at age 80.](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/over-nearly-80-years-harvard-study-has-been-showing-how-to-live-a-healthy-and-happy-life/)
	* Ambivalent relationships—those that are sometimes supportive and sometimes demeaning—are the most toxic.
* 位置不同，少言為貴；認知不同，不爭不辯；三觀不合，浪費口舌!
* Every relationship in your life can be placed within a 2x2 matrix based upon:
	1. How healthy it is
	2. How enjoyable it is
* The “Helped, Heard, or Hugged” Framework
	* Three Elements
		* **Helped:** Deconstruct the problem and identify solutions.
		* **Heard:** Listen intently and allow the other person to vent.
		* **Hugged:** Provide comforting touch
	* _“Do you want to be Helped, Heard, or Hugged?”_
	* Over the years, my Mr. Fix It mentality created a lot of tense moments with my wife, family, and friends. They’d come to me with a problem and my analytical brain would start firing, deconstructing the problem and its various potential solutions. I always found it puzzling that the other person would often reject my solutions and withdraw (or even get angry with me for offering them).
	* Sometimes people don’t want a solution, they just want you to be there with them.
* [The Go-First Principle](The%20Go-First%20Principle.md)
* Relationships are, by definition, a series of repeated interactions. In those scenarios, the best strategy is called [tit-for-tat with forgiveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat). [^2] If you only play once, the best strategy is to be selfish.
* Good “inner circle” friendships must be treasured
* Never leave a conversation without asking “how can I help you?” Everyone subconsciously values reciprocity and aid.
* Share with someone who wants to listen or listen to someone who wants to share.
* The 4 stages of attraction
	* Admiration
	* Connection
	* Commitment
	* Compatibility (Do we share the same core values?)
* Send THANK YOU notes to people you love by regularly scrolling through recent text messages instead of scrolling on social media as a form of procrastination
* A person’s favorite sound is their name.
* Keep your circle small. Keep your circle solid.
* Robin Dunbar: humans are able to maintain ~150 relationships at once (Dunbar’s Number)
* Money compounds fast but trust compounds even more
* While small talk (= idle talk = chitchat) has its place ,[^3] real bonding/conversation happens through sharing _vulnerability_ or ambition/aspirations.
	* _What’s your biggest struggle right now?_
	* _What are your top 3 life goals?_
	* _What gives you energy in your work?_
* [Vulnerability is the fastest path to connection. We’re wired to think that revealing our struggles makes us look weak. But research shows the opposite: vulnerability creates instant connection.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg48Bi9DA54)
* Shared Struggle
	* builds unbreakable bonds that transcend time and distance.
	* releases oxytocin, a chemical that creates feelings of love and connection.
	* “Trouble shared is trouble halved.” — Lee Iacocca
	* “Nothing makes one feel so strong as a call for help.” — Pope Paul VI
* If you’re trying to make conversation with someone that you are intimidated by, ask what they’re currently working on that they’re most excited about. It’s a simple question, but it gets them talking and animated. Ask follow ups and listen intently.
* Four different ways to respond when someone shares news: active constructive, passive constructive, passive destructive, and active destructive. Active constructive responses, which involve genuine engagement and building on the person’s news, are found to be the most energizing
* How to overcome <span style="font-family:SFUIText-Bold;"><b>the</b></span> **straw man argument**? use **the steelman argument**: Instead of going on the attack, we help our opponent to build the _strongest possible version_ of their argument, and then engage with _that_.
	1. **Paraphrase their point (and check to see that the agree)** - _So, if I understand you correctly, you’re saying _____. Is that right?_
	2. **Strengthen their point (and ask if they agree)** - _Interesting. You could even take it a bit further and say _____._
	3. **Only then, engage with the argument** - _That’s a compelling perspective. But, I find myself disagreeing with _____. What do you think?_
* The Principles of Connected Conversation
	* Principle 1: Create Doorknobs (that lead to a story rather than end the conversation)
	* Principle 2: Be a Loud Listener
		* <u>Sounds</u>: Saying “yes” or “uh-huh” or “hmm” to signal listening and encourage continued energy from the speaker.
		* <u>Facial Expressions</u>: Changing facial expressions to react physically to the story being told.
		* <u>Body Language</u>: Forward lean posture towards the speaker signals engagement and positive energy. Never turn away or sideways, as it signals you are trying to leave a conversation and immediately hurts the energy of a moment.
	* Principle 3: Repeat \& Follow
		* Repeating key points back to the speaker in your own words and following on with an additional insight, story, or doorknob.
	* Principle 4: Make Situational Eye Contact
		* Deep and connected while they speak.
		* Organic while you speak - It’s ok to gaze off while you think, but use eye contact to emphasize key points and moments in a story.
* The RASA Framework
	* Receive: focus your attention on what the person is saying.
	* Appreciate: show signs of appreciation.
	* Summarize: sum up in a few words what the person was telling you.
	* Ask a good question.
* **The Vampire Test**
	* “Whatever excites you, go do it. Whatever drains you, stop doing it” - Derek Sivers
	* If, after hanging out with someone you feel worn out and depleted, that person is a vampire.
	* If, after hanging out with someone you still feel full of energy, that person is not a vampire.
* The ideal dynamic relationship involves two people who are independently strong but come together to create a deeply connected, emotionally safe, and attached bond. This is in contrast to a toxic relationship where individuals focus solely on making themselves happy and then expecting to be happy together.
* While you can’t control an interrupter, what you can do is turn it into a learning experience - Rather than being offended, any time someone interrupts you, see it as a positive opportunity. Stop and hone in, understanding that this is an important issue for them.
* The 2 Pillars of Strong Relationships
	* High expectations
	* High support
	* High Support without High Expectations is a recipe for mediocrity.
	* High Expectations without High Support is a recipe for disaster.
	* Mean to your face but nice behind your back.
* **Mel Robbins’ Text Message Challenge:** If you want to improve any relationship in your life, pull out your phone and send this message to that person: **“What can I do to be a better _______ to you?”**(partner, friend, son, etc.)
* There are two red flags to avoid almost all dangerous people:
	* The perpetually aggrieved
	* The angry
* You don’t know a person until:
	* You travel with them.
	* Money is involved.
	* You deal with them when they’re angry.
	* You live with them.
* 1/3 的人「喜歡你」，1/3 的人「討厭你」，1/3 的人「隨便你」
* Judge a man by his questions rather than his answers.
* [Judge others by intentions, judge ourselves by actions](Judge%20others%20by%20intentions,%20judge%20ourselves%20by%20actions.md)
* “When you judge others, you do not define them, you define yourself.” — Earl Nightingale

[^2]: If you only play it once, the best strategy is to be selfish, according to game theory.
[^3]: While deep conversations are valuable, it’s also important to recognize that small talk can serve as a social lubricant. The key is to avoid getting stuck in perpetual triviality.

= 誘因 = anything that encourages a person (or organization) to do something.

Incentives are the most fundamental concept in [Decision Making](decision-making.md).

People respond to incentives like Pavlov's dogs, and they are more likely to act in their own self-interest, even if it contradicts their moral values.

We make time and energy for the things we really want. For example, if you have a vacation planned and need to make a 6am flight, you have no issue getting up at 3am to make it, because you have the _**desire**_.

* If you want a thing bad enough, you will always find a way to get it.

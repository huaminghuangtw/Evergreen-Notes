People tend to overestimate the degree to which other people are noticing, observing, and judging their appearance or behaviors (trivial egoic concerns)

Harsh truth in reality:

* Nobody is thinking about you as much as you are. Everyone is concerned mostly about themselves, how how _they’re_ coming across. They are just/far too busy thinking about themselves.
* Most people don’t actually care about you; They are really just going through life worried about themselves.

Stop caring about what others might think of you. _Like birds sing, not worrying about who hears._

You’ll quit worrying about what others think about you when you realize how rarely they actually think about you.

# The “No One Cares” Mindset

* _No one cares_ if I write blog posts that are a bit rambly because I haven’t had much experience of writing.
* _No one cares_ if my belt doesn’t match my shoes when I attend this party.
* _No one cares_ about the driver of Lamborghini, but they want to be the driver of Lamborghini.

## Nobody cares.

When you’re winning, when everything is going well, when you’re crushing it, nobody cares. When you’re losing, when everything is falling flat, when you’re down and out, nobody cares.

There are two big mistakes in life:

1. Worrying about what other people think about you.
2. Believing that other people think about you in the first place.

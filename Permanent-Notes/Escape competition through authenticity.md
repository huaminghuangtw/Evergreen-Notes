# The Fight Against Normalcy

> _“You can't be normal and expect abnormal returns.” — Jeffrey Pfeffer_

> _“Extreme people get extreme results.” — Sam Altman_

* Maintaining your uniqueness in a world that pulls you to blend in, is the only way to realize your full potential and live a fulfilled, texture-rich existence.
* It comes with a risk, but the rewards are abundant. It may come with a steep cost in the short-term, but the long-term rewards are worth it.

> _“Be weird. Your strangeness is your magic.” — Parker Lewis_

Normal behavior is forgotten. Only weird behavior survives. _Nobody tells stories of when you did the expected — they only tell stories when you did the unexpected._ Normalize being weird. Weirdness is what sets us apart, makes us unique. Be your unapologetically weird self. In fact, being weird may even find you the ultimate happiness.

1. If you pay for the bill at everyone in the table — the short-term reaction is shock and confusion. In the long term, it's everyone's favorite memory of you.
2. If you travel across the world for a friend's birthday, the friend's initial reaction is: “You don't have to do that” — but it's the story they tell at your funeral.
3. If you're 100% honest with your feedback on people's business ideas, the short-term reaction is anger. In the long term, you become one of the few people they trust.

[To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/876-to-be-yourself-in-a-world-that-is-constantly-trying) Be true to yourself.

Sometimes becoming who you are is actually about _unbecoming_ who you aren't.

* Uncondition/Undo yourself

The world doesn't need one more _template_. It needs one more _rebel_.

Attract \> Chase

> _“If you spend your time chasing butterflies, they'll fly away. But if you spend your time making/mending a beautiful garden, the butterflies will come.” — Mario Quintana_ [^3]

---

What you are good at is different from what you are genetically encoded for.

---

Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. Remember that life is an adventure.

> _“If the path before you is clear, you're probably on someone else's.” — Joseph Campbell_

找到只有你能做得好的一件事，你就會事半功倍，最後你將成為那件事的世界第一，並且熱愛生命

Find a thing that's so you, that doing it is just a natural extension of you being yourself.

[Your best performances will come when you are working in a way that is a full expression of you. The work becomes a natural display of your personality. This is when you not only get better results, but also love the activity — because in doing the craft, you feel alive.](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/january-30-2025)

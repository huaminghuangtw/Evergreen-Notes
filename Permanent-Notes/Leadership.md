> “When we select leaders, we don’t usually pick the person with the strongest leadership skills. We frequently choose the person who talks the most. It’s called the babble effect. Research shows that groups promote the people who command the most airtime—regardless of their aptitude and expertise. We mistake confidence for competence, certainty for credibility, and quantity for quality. We get stuck following people who dominate the discussion instead of those who elevate it.” — Adam M. Grant, [Hidden Potential: The Science of Achieving Greater Things](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/170223349)

優秀的管理者投資於績效，偉大的管理者則投資於潛力。

Leadership is seeing the greatness in others before they see it in themselves.

When you find yourself in a situation where everyone looks at each other, it’s time for you to lead the way.

* We all have the opportunity to make an impact, even when we’re not standing at the front. When you choose to step up, you may discover that that leadership is more complex than it appears and develop greater empathy for those in leadership roles. Learn to lead by constantly asking yourself, “What would I say should I suddenly be called upon to lead?”

* 造船工人
	* If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work and give orders. Instead, teach/inspire them to yearn for the vast and endless sea. Audacious ideas motivate people.
	* You should not build something just for the sake of building. You should build something because it will help you to fulfill a dream, in this case, going to sea.

# True Leadership Is Service-oriented

Think of a great leader like a captain of a ship: they make sure everyone is safe and settled before they themselves rest.

“I can afford to wait, because I trust myself and my tribe.”

Insecure leaders rush to take first, fearing there’s not enough. Confident leaders **create abundance** by leading with stability and assurance.

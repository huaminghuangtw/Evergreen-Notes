The relationship you have with yourself sets the tone for the relationship you have with everyone else, which will rarely be healthier than your self-esteem.

 [Self-esteem is the reputation that you have with yourself.](https://x.com/naval/status/819595652644491264) If you want to have high self-esteem, earn your self-respect first. The hardest respect to earn is one’s own. Treat yourself with respect.

The internal golden rule: treat yourself the way others should have treated you.

People respect you, only as much as you respect yourself. Others treat you the way you treat yourself.

# The “Body Swap” Reframe

If you switched bodies with the person you love most for a year, how would you take care of their mind & body knowing you’d be giving it back to them? How would you take care of that person you love the most? Now do that for you.

> _[“There are two basic motivating forces: fear and love. When we are afraid, we pull back from life. When we are in love, we open to all that life has to offer with passion, excitement, and acceptance. We need to learn to love ourselves first, in all our glory and our imperfections. If we cannot love ourselves, we cannot fully open to our ability to love others or our potential to create. Evolution and all hopes for a better world rest in the fearlessness and open-hearted vision of people who embrace life.” — John Lennon](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/26411-there-are-two-basic-motivating-forces-fear-and-love-when)_

Prefer dignity (尊嚴) for yourself. Don’t be afraid to be thought arrogant or selfish. The most courageous act is to think for yourself. Aloud.

Always put yourself first. Self-prioritize yourself. Take care of yourself before taking care of others, so that you can give them your best self. Self-care is giving the world the best of you instead of what’s left of you. **Self-care isn’t selfish.**

# The Ability To Love Yourself Improves Your Ability To Be Loved.

* We are unlikely to accept a relationship that is worse than the one we have with ourselves, and thus the person who is happy and comfortable with themselves is in a great position. The person with healthy self-esteem doesn’t have to jump into any relationship because they already have a great one wherever they go.
* If the time you spend alone is already enjoyable to some degree—that is, if you have a healthy [internal monologue](be-careful-how-you-are-talking-to-yourself.md) and generally feel good about yourself—then you will have a fairly high bar for the type of relationships you’ll enter.
* But if you’re unhappy with yourself, then you are more likely to put up with bad relationships because they may occasionally make you feel better than you do alone. If you want a great relationship, the first thing you want is to be comfortable with yourself.

Learn to laugh at yourself. The more you can laugh at yourself, the happier you’ll be. When you screw something up, practice laughing at yourself instead of beating yourself up / wrestling with yourself.

> _[“Over the years, I have come to realize that the greatest trap in our life is not success, popularity, or power, but self-rejection. Success, popularity, and power can indeed present a great temptation, but their seductive quality often comes from the way they are part of the much larger temptation to self-rejection. When we have come to believe in the voices that call us worthless and unlovable, then success, popularity, and power are easily perceived as attractive solutions. The real trap, however, is self-rejection. As soon as someone accuses me or criticizes me, as soon as I am rejected, left alone, or abandoned, I find myself thinking, "Well, that proves once again that I am a nobody." ... \[My dark side says,\] I am no good... I deserve to be pushed aside, forgotten, rejected, and abandoned. Self-rejection is the greatest enemy of the spiritual life because it contradicts the sacred voice that calls us the "Beloved." Being the Beloved constitutes the core truth of our existence.” — Henri J.M. Nouwen](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/230436-over-the-years-i-have-come-to-realize-that-the)_

The relationship you have with yourself sets the tone for the relationship you have with everyone else, which will rarely be healthier than your self-esteem.

 [Self-esteem is the reputation that you have with yourself.](https://x.com/naval/status/819595652644491264) If you want to have high self-esteem, earn your self-respect first. The hardest respect to earn is one’s own. Treat yourself with respect.

> _“We live in a world with a lot of insecure, jealous people. Some of them are our best friends. They are blood relatives. Failure terrifies them. So does our success. Because when we transcend what we once thought possible, push our limits, and become more, our light reflects off all the walls they’ve built up around them. Your light enables them to see the contours of their own prison, their own self-limitations. But if they are truly the great people you always believed them to be, their jealousy will evolve, and soon their imagination might hop its fence, and it will be their turn to change for the better.” — [@gogginsCantHurtMe2018]_

And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.” ― Marianne Williamson, A Return to Love: Reflections on the Principles of “A Course in Miracles”](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/928-our-deepest-fear-is-not-that-we-are-inadequate-our)_ [^5]

The internal golden rule: treat yourself the way others should have treated you.

People respect you, only as much as you respect yourself. Others treat you the way you treat yourself.

---

If you switched bodies with the person you love most for a year, how would you take care of their mind & body knowing you’d be giving it back to them? How would you take care of that person you love the most? Now do that for you.

---

Always put yourself first. Self-prioritize yourself. Take care of yourself before taking care of others, so that you can give them your best self. Self-care is giving the world the best of you instead of what’s left of you. **Self-care isn’t selfish.**

# The Ability To Love Yourself Improves Your Ability To Be Loved.

* We are unlikely to accept a relationship that is worse than the one we have with ourselves, and thus the person who is happy and comfortable with themselves is in a great position. The person with healthy self-esteem doesn’t have to jump into any relationship because they already have a great one wherever they go.
* If the time you spend alone is already enjoyable to some degree—that is, if you have a healthy [internal monologue](be-careful-how-you-are-talking-to-yourself.md) and generally feel good about yourself—then you will have a fairly high bar for the type of relationships you’ll enter.
* But if you’re unhappy with yourself, then you are more likely to put up with bad relationships because they may occasionally make you feel better than you do alone. If you want a great relationship, the first thing you want is to be comfortable with yourself.

Learn to laugh at yourself. The more you can laugh at yourself, the happier you’ll be. When you screw something up, practice laughing at yourself instead of beating yourself up / wrestling with yourself.

> _[“Over the years, I have come to realize that the greatest trap in our life is not success, popularity, or power, but self-rejection. Success, popularity, and power can indeed present a great temptation, but their seductive quality often comes from the way they are part of the much larger temptation to self-rejection. When we have come to believe in the voices that call us worthless and unlovable, then success, popularity, and power are easily perceived as attractive solutions. The real trap, however, is self-rejection. As soon as someone accuses me or criticizes me, as soon as I am rejected, left alone, or abandoned, I find myself thinking, "Well, that proves once again that I am a nobody." ... [My dark side says,] I am no good... I deserve to be pushed aside, forgotten, rejected, and abandoned. Self-rejection is the greatest enemy of the spiritual life because it contradicts the sacred voice that calls us the "Beloved." Being the Beloved constitutes the core truth of our existence.” — Henri J.M. Nouwen](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/230436-over-the-years-i-have-come-to-realize-that-the)_

做自己的太陽，你就能當別人的光；讓自己發光，就能照亮別人。[如果你心中有願望，請看著天上的星星，對自己許願。](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ziTd2w06xk&t=18m39s)

* 印度詩人泰戈爾《用生命影響生命》：「把自己活成一道光，因爲你不知道，誰會藉著你的光，走出了黑暗。請保持心中的善良，因爲你不知道，誰會藉著你的善良，走出了絕望。請保持你心中的信仰，因爲你不知道，誰會藉著你的信仰，走出了迷茫。請相信自己的力量，因爲你不知道，誰會因爲相信你，開始相信了自己。」

* _“Try to be a rainbow in someone’s cloud.” — Maya Angelou_
* _“We live in a world with a lot of insecure, jealous people. Some of them are our best friends. They are blood relatives. Failure terrifies them. So does our success. Because when we transcend what we once thought possible, push our limits, and become more, our light reflects off all the walls they’ve built up around them. Your light enables them to see the contours of their own prison, their own self-limitations. But if they are truly the great people you always believed them to be, their jealousy will evolve, and soon their imagination might hop its fence, and it will be their turn to change for the better.” — [@gogginsCantHurtMe2018]_
* _[“We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.” ― Marianne Williamson, A Return to Love: Reflections on the Principles of “A Course in Miracles”](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/928-our-deepest-fear-is-not-that-we-are-inadequate-our)_ [^5]

The internal golden rule: treat yourself the way others should have treated you.

People respect you, only as much as you respect yourself. Others treat you the way you treat yourself.

---

Always put yourself first. Self-prioritize yourself. Take care of yourself before taking care of others, so that you can give them your best self. Self-care is giving the world the best of you instead of what’s left of you. **Self-care isn’t selfish.**

先自強，再助人

要先自私，才能無私

# The Ability To Love Yourself Improves Your Ability To Be Loved.

* We are unlikely to accept a relationship that is worse than the one we have with ourselves, and thus the person who is happy and comfortable with themselves is in a great position. The person with healthy self-esteem doesn’t have to jump into any relationship because they already have a great one wherever they go.
* If the time you spend alone is already enjoyable to some degree—that is, if you have a healthy [internal monologue](be-careful-how-you-are-talking-to-yourself.md) and generally feel good about yourself—then you will have a fairly high bar for the type of relationships you’ll enter.
* But if you’re unhappy with yourself, then you are more likely to put up with bad relationships because they may occasionally make you feel better than you do alone. If you want a great relationship, the first thing you want is to be comfortable with yourself.

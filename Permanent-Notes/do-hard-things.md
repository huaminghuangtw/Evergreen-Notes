> _“Our culture has become hooked on the quick-fix, the life hack, efficiency. Everyone is on the hunt for that simple action algorithm that nets maximum profit with the least amount of effort. There’s no denying this attitude may get you some of the trappings of success, if you’re lucky, but it will not lead to a calloused mind or self-mastery.

Because passion and obsession, even talent, are only useful tools if you have the work ethic to back them up.” — [@gogginsCantHurtMe2018]_

# The Warrior in the Garden

One day, a young warrior was walking to his training when he spotted his teacher, a master warrior, tending to plants in the garden.

He approached cautiously and stood quietly, not wanting to disturb the man from whom he had learned so much.

“What is it you want?” Asked the master warrior, without breaking focus from the plants.

The student replied, “Why do we train for war? Would it not be more tranquil and serene to be a gardener and tend the plants?”

The master paused, turned to the student, and smiled.

“Tending the garden is a relaxing pastime, but it does not prepare one for the inevitable battles of life. It’s easy to be calm in such a serene setting. It’s hard to be calm when under attack.”

The student nodded and turned away, satisfied with the answer, but the master wasn’t finished.

> _“If you have 2 choices to make and they’re relatively equal (50-50), take the path that is more difficult and painful in the short term.” — Naval Ravikant_

> _“Easy choices, hard life. [^1] Hard choices, easy life.” — Jerzy Gregorek_

> _“The costs of your good [habits](be-a-habit-and-routine-machine.md) are in the present. The costs of your bad [habits](be-a-habit-and-routine-machine.md) are in the future.” — James Clear_

* [Short-term pain](instant-gratification.md) typically creates compounding [long-term gain](delayed-gratification.md).
* [Short-term cost pays long-term dividend.](everything-in-life-has-an-opportunity-cost.md)
* Every gain in life comes from [compound interests](the-compounding-effect.md). Almost all mistakes in life come from short-term thinking. The things that _feel good to us_ in the short-term are rarely the things that _are good for us_ in the long-term.

Comfort is the most seductive thing in existence. Comfort is not free. It comes at the cost of who you could become. Step into the unknown. The unknown is the foundry where you forge your chips. Everything important is uncertain. **Sitting with the discomfort of that [uncertainty](life-is-chaotic.md) is the hard part, the wedge that can move the world.**

When things get hard, the mental gymnastics start—you start convincing yourself that it’s ok to ease up, that [the clear path to your lesser goals](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/875504-we-are-kept-from-our-goal-not-by-obstacles-but) looks pretty darn good. At this moment, tell yourself: “_It’s supposed/meant to be hard/difficult. If it were easy, everyone would do it._”

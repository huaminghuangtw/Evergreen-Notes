# 🕰️ What is Chronotype?

**Chronotype（生理時型）** refers to your natural preference for sleep and activity times. It determines **when you're most alert, productive, and energetic** during the day. It's influenced by your internal **circadian rhythm** and largely shaped by genetics.

In simple terms, chronotype tells you: **“What kind of internal clock person are you?”**

# ⏰ 4 Common Chronotypes (Animal Types)

These are based on Dr. Michael Breus's book _The Power of When_:

| Chronotype | Peak Productivity Time          | Traits                                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🐻 Bear    | 9:00–17:00 (daytime)            | Most people fall here; energy rises and falls with the sun. |
| 🦁 Lion    | 6:00–14:00 (early morning)      | Early risers; energized in the morning, fade by evening.    |
| 🐺 Wolf    | 13:00–21:00 (afternoon/evening) | Night owls; slow starters, peak later in the day.           |
| 🐬 Dolphin | Unpredictable                   | Light sleepers, easily disturbed, irregular energy.         |

* **Smarter scheduling:** Tackle hard tasks when you're naturally most alert.
* **Avoid energy mismatches:** Night owls should avoid deep work early in the morning.
* **Better lifestyle choices:** Sleep, eat, and exercise at times aligned with your internal rhythm.

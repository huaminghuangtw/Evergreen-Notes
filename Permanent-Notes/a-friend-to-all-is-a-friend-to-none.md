Humans are mimetic creatures. We copy those around us. Decentralized friend groups are medicine for the mimetic mind.

* **Decentralized Friend Groups:** You have many small clusters of different friends who aren’t connected. The only thing they have in common is that they know you. Ambitious friends, fun friends, serious friends, relaxed friends, fitness friends, hometown friends, traveling friends, etc.
* **Centralized Friend Groups:** You have one large cluster of friends. They all share the same history, beliefs and behaviors. They usually fit in one box. Examples: “School friends” or “Work friends”

[Most of your friends aren't really your friends. They're just along for the ride when it's fun, convenient, or valuable. They'll be gone when it's none of those things. Your real friends are there for you when you have *nothing* to offer in return. Find them. Cherish them. Be one to someone else.](https://x.com/SahilBloom/status/1513143690423934977)

There are two types of friends:

* **Summer Friends** are the ones who are there for you when it’s warm and sunny, but disappear when the weather starts to turn. They are the seasonal tourists, not the locals.
	* Most people in your life are Summer Friends, and when winter inevitably comes, they are gone.
* **Winter Friends** are the ones who are there for you when it’s cold and dark. They are the locals, who have the wisdom to know that the seasons come and go.
	* The Winter Friends are the relationships that you really need to cultivate. Those are the people who will be there for you throughout the different seasons of your life.

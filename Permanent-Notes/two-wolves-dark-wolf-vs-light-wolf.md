A grandfather takes his grandson on a walk to share his wisdom for life.

“A fight is going on inside me,” he tells the boy. “It’s a terrible fight between two wolves — a dark and a light wolf. The dark wolf represents envy, arrogance, anxiety, ego, inferiority, regret, greed, self-pity, guilt, false pride, fear, pain, anger, hate, jealousy, rage; the light wolf represents love, peace, humility, kindness, serenity, generosity, trust, tranquility, compassion, empathy, optimism, hope, joy, gratitude.”

The boy asks, “Which wolf will win?”

To which the grandfather replies:

**“The one you feed.”**

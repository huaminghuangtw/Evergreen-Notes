Rewire your brain

= Reframe your thinking

= Reprogram your mindset

= Reshape your perspective

---

It’s not the load that breaks you down, it’s the way you carry it.

---

The ability to choose one thought over another is superpower—one shift in our thoughts can completely change how we feel.

# The Law Of Attraction (吸引力法則)

* You become what you constantly think about.
	* Easy to spot a yellow car when you are always thinking of a yellow car.
	* Easy to spot opportunity when you are always thinking of opportunity.
	* Easy to spot reasons to be mad when you are always thinking of being mad.
* Your dominant thoughts shape your perception of the world. By intentionally focusing on positive, constructive thoughts, you can train your mind to seek out opportunities, solutions, and happiness instead of obstacles and negativity.
* **[Think Yourself Thin](https://www.yourtango.com/health-wellness/ways-think-yourself-thin-harvard-study-shock-you)** — Believing effort leads to [improvement](The%20Growth%20Mindset.md), which increases motivation and drives more effort.

You can’t change your past, but you can reframe it. Find the lesson in it. Find the opportunity in it. _You can’t choose your history, but you can always choose the story you tell about it._ [Rewrite the story you tell yourself](be-careful-how-you-are-talking-to-yourself.md).

---

It’s not what you _look at_ that matters. It’s what you _see_ that matters.

---

Often when you think you’re at the end of something, you’re at the beginning of something else.

* “I am really anxious.” → “I am experiencing anxiety.”
	* You are not your feelings. Just because you’re experiencing anxious feelings doesn’t mean it’s an inherent part of who you are.
	* We are not our emotions. We are not sad or anxious (_feeling emotions_). We have sadness or anxiety on us (_being emotions_).
		* I am sad. → There is sadness on me.
		* I am anxious. → There is anxiety on me.
* “How hard it is? (這有多難?)” → “How hard can it be? (這能有多難?)”
* “以後不知道該怎麼辦…” → 不知道以後會怎樣耶!
* “[I am afraid to fail.](Fear%20of%20Failure%20and%20Success.md)” → “I am excited to try.”
* “Life happens to me.” → “I have agency. I can influence my outcomes.”
	* Reactive Living → [Proactive Living](intentional-living.md)
	* This is the essence of habit one in Stephen R. Covey’s renowned book [@covey7HabitsHighly2013]: **Be Proactive.** Everything starts there.

* Decision → Experiment
* Problem → Puzzle
* [Relax](rest,%20reset,%20relax,%20recharge.md) → Energize
* Should → Could
* [Failure](Failing%20forward%20turns%20setbacks%20into%20stepping%20stones.md) → Data point

See failure as opportunity; See rejection as redirection; See frustration as fascination

Rejection is the Universe’s protection.

# Failures are only failures if you see them that way. No failure is ever just a failure—it’s an invitation to try something new.

* If your goal is to find a fulfilling career and your hypothesis is that a corporate role might be fulfilling, then your data collection process might be to sample careers through internships and job placements. With an experimental mindset, an internship that you end up hating wouldn’t be a ‘failure’ or a ‘waste of time’; it’d just be another data point to help you realize that that’s not what you want.
* If your goal is to build a successful business, then your data collection process might involve testing different business ideas, products or services. With an experimental mindset, a product launch that doesn’t meet expectations wouldn’t be a failure or a disaster; it’d just be another data point to help you refine your strategy and better understand your target market.
* If your goal is to develop meaningful relationships, then your data collection process might involve going on dates, attending social events and engaging with new people. With an experimental mindset, a date that doesn’t lead to a second one or a friendship that doesn’t blossom wouldn’t be a failure; it’d just be another data point to help you understand your compatibility.

# The “Be-Do-Have” Model

The traditional line of thinking is Have, Do, Be:

* I need to have X.
* Then I can do Y.
* Then I will be Z.

A classic example: _I need to have more money and fancy things, then I can do the things I want, then I’ll be fulfilled._

The reality: The conditional approach—if I have X, then I’ll be Y—never works.

Be, Do, Have flips this traditional thinking on its head:

* I will be Z.
* Then I can do Y.
* Then I will have X.

In the context of our example: _I will embody the state of being of a fulfilled person, then I can do the actions of a fulfilled person, then I will have the things I desire._

> Once we become aware of the fact that we are only feeling what we’re thinking and that thinking is the root cause of our unpleasant experience, we see it for what it truly is. Then we allow it to settle by giving it space, and slowly we will see how we begin to have a clear mind again.

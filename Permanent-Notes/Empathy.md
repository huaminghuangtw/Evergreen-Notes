> _“It’s important to make sure that we’re talking with each other in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.” — Barack Obama_

> _[“People have boldness to criticize but not to sensitize.” — Amit Kalantri](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1134221-people-have-boldness-to-criticize-but-not-to-sensitize)_

> _“When you show deep empathy toward others, their defensive energy goes down, and positive energy replaces it.” — Stephen Covey_

> _“Perspective taking is listening to the truth as other people experience it and acknowledging it as the truth. What you see is as true, real and honest as what I see, so let me be quiet for a minute, listen and learn about what you see. Let me get curious about what you see. Let me ask questions about what you see._

> _Empathy is incompatible with shame and judgment. [Staying out of judgment](dispel-your-narratives.md) requires understanding. **We tend to judge those areas where we’re the most vulnerable to feeling shame ourselves. We don’t tend to judge in areas where our sense of self-worth is stable and secure.** In order to stay out of judgment, we must pay attention to our own triggers and issues._

> _Empathy (同理) reduces shame, whereas sympathy (同情) exacerbates it. There is a huge difference between **feeling with someone** and **feeling for someone**. Shame causes a person to believe they’re alone. Through empathy, we cause them to realize that they are not alone, which is why it is the antidote to shame.” — Brené Brown_

The phenomenon of **“empathic stress”** causes individuals who are exposed to people who are stressed to experience stress themselves.

If someone feels **同情 compassion (“I want to relieve your suffering.”)** for a stressed person instead of **同理 empathy (“I feel your suffering.”)**, they may be less likely to take on that person’s [stress](stress-and-anxiety.md).

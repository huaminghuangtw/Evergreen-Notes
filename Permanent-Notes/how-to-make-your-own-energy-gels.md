* The key ingredient in most gels is a carbohydrate powder called [Maltodextrin](../Maltodextrin.md). It’s a white powder that looks a lot like flour and has virtually no taste to the tongue.
* The other ingredient you’ll need is [fructose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructose), often called “fruit sugar”.

# Ingredients

* **Maltodextrin** – for quick energy release
* **Dates** (Medjool or Deglet Noor) – natural sugar + potassium
* **Water** – adjust to desired consistency
* **Salt** – for electrolytes
* **Lemon juice** (or a pinch of citric acid) – for taste and preservation

# Tips

* Add a bit of chia seeds (soaked) for a thicker, slower-digesting gel.

# How To Carry It?

* For short runs, I used a small 3-oz shampoo travel container. For longer runs, I fill as much as I need in one of the 10-oz handheld running water bottles on my water belt.

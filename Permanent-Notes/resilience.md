1. 脆弱 Fragile：遇到變動就損壞（如玻璃杯）
2. 強韌 Robust：可以承受變動但無法從中受益（如壺鈴）
3. 非脆弱 Antifragile：[愈挫愈勇，在混亂中茁壯](The%20Growth%20Mindset.md)（如創作作品、實驗性的想法）

The more easily you get offended, the less emotional intelligence you have. Invest your emotions wisely. Don't engage in any fruitless arguments.

> _“Think of life like a play, and it will ease your mind when you're challenged or when someone stands in your way. Told yourself they were playing a role. **Every story needs a villain.** So why should you waste energy being upset at the villains in your story? Instead, you could use that energy as the fuel to beat them.” — Arnold Schwarzenegger_

> _“Never wrestle with a pig in the mud because you'll both get dirty and the pig likes it”. — George Bernard Shaw_

> _“You cannot control the behavior of others, but you can always choose how you respond to it.” — Roy T. Bennett_

> _“It is difficult to free fools from the chains they revere.” — Voltaire_

* 不要和白痴吵架

	* _“If a lion turned every time small dogs barked at it, it would be the laughing stock of the jungle.” — Matshona Dhliwayo_
* 如果別人朝著你丟石頭，就不要扔回去了，留著做你建高樓的基石。
* 有些人是真心來對話的，有些人是純心來吵架的，分清楚兩者之間的差異！
* [“Taking Souls (收割靈魂)” by David Goggins](https://www.google.com/search?q=taking+souls+david+goggings)
	* Love your enemies—not by seeking their approval, but by turning your feelings about them into fuel. Let their doubt drive you. [Be so exceptional at what you do](always-do-your-best-as-possible.md) that they're forced to respect you, not out of affection, but awe. They don't need to like you. It's about earning respect through undeniable excellence, shattering their preconceptions with your relentless work and undeniable results.
* [Reminder: If someone is acting like an idiot, you can just move on and let them be wrong. You do not have a personal obligation to correct people who are committed to being stupid. Sure, sometimes you need to attempt to get on the same page, but usually you can simply reclaim your time and move on to more productive ventures.](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/april-24-2025)

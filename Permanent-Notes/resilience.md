[@talebAntifragileThingsThat2016]

面對未知，我們的反應分為三種：

1. 脆弱 Fragile：遇到變動就損壞（如玻璃杯）
2. 強韌 Robust：可以承受變動但無法從中受益（如壺鈴）
3. 非脆弱 Antifragile：[愈挫愈勇，在混亂中茁壯](the-growth-mindset.md)（如創作作品、實驗性的想法）

> In the midst of hate, I found there was, within me, an invincible love.
>
> In the midst of tears, I found there was, within me, an invincible smile.
>
> In the midst of chaos, I found there was, within me, an invincible calm.
>
> I realized, through it all, that in the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.

> And that makes me happy. For it says that no matter how hard the world pushes against me, within me, there’s something stronger — something better, pushing right back.

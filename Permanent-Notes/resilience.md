# Antifragility

[@talebAntifragileThingsThat2016]

面對未知，我們的反應分為三種：

1. 脆弱 Fragile：遇到變動就損壞（如玻璃杯）
2. 強韌 Robust：可以承受變動但無法從中受益（如壺鈴）
3. 非脆弱 Antifragile：[愈挫愈勇，在混亂中茁壯](the-growth-mindset.md)（如創作作品、實驗性的想法）

Every challenge is a reminder that you were brought into the world to do something that requires your [courage](Courage%20is%20knowing%20what%20not%20to%20fear.md) to awaken.

Forget all the reasons why it won’t work and believe the one reason why it will.

Resistance, obstacles, and roadblocks lead to growth. “A gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a man perfected without trials.”

The more easily you get offended, the less emotional intelligence you have. Invest your emotions wisely. Don’t engage in any fruitless arguments.

> _“Think of life like a play, and it will ease your mind when you’re challenged or when someone stands in your way.

Instead, you could use that energy as the fuel to beat them.” — Arnold Schwarzenegger_

* 不要和白痴吵架
	* If you argue with a fool, you become one.

	* _“If a lion turned every time small dogs barked at it, it would be the laughing stock of the jungle.” — Matshona Dhliwayo_
* 如果別人朝著你丟石頭，就不要扔回去了，留著做你建高樓的基石。

	> _“Always aspire to act in a way that cancels out someone else’s cruel or stupid behavior.” — Carl Hiaasen_

	* 「逆境菩薩」
	* Love your enemies—not by seeking their approval, but by turning your feelings about them into fuel. Let their doubt drive you. [Be so exceptional at what you do](always-do-your-best-as-possible.md) that they’re forced to respect you, not out of affection, but awe. They don’t need to like you. It’s about earning respect through undeniable excellence, shattering their preconceptions with your relentless work and undeniable results.
* [Reminder: If someone is acting like an idiot, you can just move on and let them be wrong. You do not have a personal obligation to correct people who are committed to being stupid. Sure, sometimes you need to attempt to get on the same page, but usually you can simply reclaim your time and move on to more productive ventures.](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/april-24-2025)

> One day, a Donkey and a Tiger got into an argument over the color of the grass.
> ​
> “The grass is blue,” said the Donkey.
> ​
> “That’s ridiculous,” replied the Tiger. “The grass is clearly green.”
> ​
> When the argument grew more and more intense, they decided to find the Lion, King of the Jungle, to settle the debate.
> ​
> When they approached the Lion, the Donkey exclaimed, “Your Highness, isn’t it true that the grass is blue?”
> ​
> “Yes,” the Lion calmly answered, “The grass is blue.”
> ​
> Not yet satisfied, the Donkey continued, “The Tiger disagrees and argues with me. You must punish him.”
> ​
> The Lion nodded, “I will. The Tiger will be punished with a year of silence.”
> ​
> The Donkey walked off into the jungle, celebrating his victory.
> ​
> Before the Tiger turned to leave, he looked up at the Lion. “Your Highness, why have you punished me? After all, you must see the grass is clearly green.”
> ​
> The Lion nodded, “Yes, of course the grass is green.”
> ​
> “Then why am I being punished?” asked the Tiger.
> ​
> **“Because someone as wise as you should never waste time proving anything to a fool.”**

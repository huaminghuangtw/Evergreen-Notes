> _“Conditions are never perfect. 'Someday”' is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you. Pro and con lists are just as bad. If it's important to you and you want to do it 'eventually,' just do it and correct course along the way.” ― Timothy Ferriss, [The 4-Hour Workweek](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1885647)_

Perfectionism is a [double-edged sword (雙面刃)](Duality%20versus%20Polarity.md).

On the other hand, it can lead to chronic dissatisfaction and overwhelming stress.

# The Challenges Of Perfectionism

1. **[Fear of Failure:](Fear%20of%20Failure%20and%20Success.md)** Perfectionists often avoid taking risks due to the fear of making mistakes or not meeting their own high standards.
2. **[Procrastination:](Procrastination.md)** The pressure to produce perfect work can lead to avoidance behaviors, where individuals [overthink](overthinking.md) and delay starting tasks due to anxiety about their performance.
3. **[Burnout:](Burnout.md)** Constant striving for perfection is exhausting and can lead to physical and mental burnout.
4. **[Low Self-Esteem:](Your%20relationship%20with%20yourself%20sets%20the%20tone%20for%20every%20other%20relationships%20you%20have.md)** Perfectionists may tie their self-worth closely to their achievements, leading to feelings of inadequacy when they inevitably fall short.

> _“Premature optimization is the root of all evil.” — Donald Knuth_ [^2]

Done is better than perfect. — First make it work. Then optimize (pretty, efficient, documented). Don't over-engineer. Never start to scale/optimize things too early. Use [feedback](feedback.md) for fast iterations. _**It's okay to be wrong.**_

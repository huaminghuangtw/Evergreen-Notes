We should be optimistic because we believe that our capacity to solve problems is greater than we thought.” — from TED Talk “[The Future Will Be Shaped by Optimists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrqBWQ-mVEc)” by Kevin Kelly_

> _“[Cynacism](__temp__cynacism.md) is easy. Mimicry is easy. Optimistic contrarians are the rarest breed.” — Naval Ravikant_

* 悲觀者：只剩半杯水 (half-empty)

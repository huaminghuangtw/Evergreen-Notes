> _“You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.” — Jim Rohn_

> _“If you are wondering who your people are, they are the ones who make your heart feel seen and your nervous system feel calm.” — Yung Pueblo_

> _“The closer you want to get to me, the better your values have to be” — Navel Ravikant_

> _[“Everyone you meet is a part of your journey, but not all of them are meant to stay in your life. Some people are just passing through to bring you gifts; either they’re blessings or lessons.” — Roy T. Bennett, The Light in the Heart](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7929987-everyone-you-meet-is-a-part-of-your-journey-but)_ [^1]

---

Find people who want _[relationships](relationships.md)_, not _transactions_.

---

People who avoid their own feelings will neglect yours.

---

愛有等差 — 斷捨離大部分的人生過客，把寶貴時間花在那些很努力想要留在我們生命裡的人。

---

物以類聚

---

近朱者赤，近墨者黑。

---

Some people talk to you in their free time and some people free their time to talk to you.

---

A person is either _holding you back_ (like boat anchors) or _pushing/driving you forward_. There is no in between.

Three types of people in your life (by Tyler Perry):

* <u>Leaves</u>: These are the people that are only around from time to time (every now and then) when the weather is good. They blow around as the winds change. They provide shade during the summer, but as soon as winter comes, they fall off the tree and disappear.
* <u>Branches</u>: These are the people who are more present and stable than the leaves, but they aren’t permanent. They look strong, but if you try to stand on them or pull yourself up from them, they may break under your weight.
* <u>Roots</u>: These are the people who are permanent. They are deep and wide. They are there in the summer and the winter, they are unperturbed by the changing seasons. The leaves and branches may come and go, but the roots are there forever.

Surround yourself with 3 types of people:

1. Peers you can grow with.
2. Mentors you can learn from.
3. Mentees you can teach.

---

Surround yourself with people…

* you’d want to spend your last day of life with.
	* Take the time to think about who we would want to spend our “last day” of life with—and then spend “tomorrow” with them.
	* Don’t wait until your “last day” to spend time with the people who truly matter—because you never know when that “last day” will come.
* who make your eyes light up.
* who think differently than you.

> _“When you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.” — Friedrich Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil_
>
> 「當你凝視深淵時，深淵也在凝視著你。」— 尼采《善惡的彼岸》

* [Cucumbers get more pickled than brine gets cucumbered.](https://www.darencademy.com/article/view/id/16913)
* 新鮮黃瓜進入醃罐時或許仍保有本色，但時間一久，也會被環境悄悄改變，成為另一條醃黃瓜。

Find your “Front Row People.”

---

You have to be very selective with whom you give your _time_, _energy_, and _attention_. Don’t fall for the “[Yes Man](if-it-isnt-fuck-yes-then-its-clear-no-thank-you.md)” trap. The more successful you become, the more people will want to massage your ego. Cherish the _truth tellers_ in your life.

* Most of us need fewer [friends](a-friend-to-all-is-a-friend-to-none.md) and more **_intellectual sparring partners_**. Friends are easy to come by. Intellectual sparring partners are harder to find. They will call you on your BS, question your assumptions, and push you to think deeply. [^4]

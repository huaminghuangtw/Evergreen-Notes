> _[More generally, tasks that require little concentration seem to be best done in batches if possible, while tasks that require a lot of concentration seem to be best done individually, with as few distractions as one can manage.](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/08/07/on-time-management/)_

# Type I: Reflective Work

* ≈ [deep work](deep%20work.md) ≈ real work ≈ high-value work
* Things we can to do to _progress_ our life
* e.g., focused tasks, “important but not urgent” tasks
* _“Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skills and are hard to replicate.” — [@newportDeepWorkRules2016]_
* Better done in “[single-tasking](You%20can%20achieve%20anything%20if%20you%20focus%20on%20one%20thing%20at%20a%20time.md)” mode

# Type Ii: Reactive Work

* ≈ shallow work ≈ fake/pseudo work ≈ low-value work
* Things we have to do to _maintain_ our life (i.e., status quo) [^1]
* e.g., administrative, logistical, and maintenance tasks, [checking messages&emails](Batching%20Emails%20and%20Text%20Messages.md), household chores, etc.
* _“Non cognitively demanding logistical-style tasks often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.” — [@newportDeepWorkRules2016]_
* Better done in “multi-tasking” mode [^2]

It's crucial to schedule time for both types of work to keep life in order. Think of it like managing a boat: _admin tasks_ are like bailing out water that's piling up — essential for keeping the boat afloat but not propelling it forward. On the other hand, _focused tasks_ are like rowing, actively moving you toward your goals and desired direction. Neglecting either can lead to problems; too much focus on rowing without managing admin tasks might sink the boat due to neglected responsibilities like taxes or bills. Striking a balance ensures both progress and stability.

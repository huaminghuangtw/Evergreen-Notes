# Rules

* Write down ANYTHING that comes across your mind. Never miss writing down or document a good thought/task/note. Nothing is too big or too small. Nothing counts other than what you capture.
* Always carry a **A7 tear-off notepad (pocket notebook)** and a **0.5mm mechanical pencil (soft 2B leads)** with me

# Why?

* The cost of digital storage is very cheap.
* Our brain is made for generating/having ideas, not keeping/holding/storing them. (我們的大腦是用來作出思考和判斷的，它並不擅長用來儲存信息)
	* ~~Keep X in mind~~, ~~Remember X~~
	* 隨時清空/梳理大腦 (Brain Dump / Cognitive Offloading)，才能處理當下的思考與判斷，並檢視自己的「迷思 (myth)」和「盲點 (blind spot)」

---

# How?

* In 📥 \& Out 📤 Paper Tray
* Quick Note
	* Informal sketch (by giving barely enough details to allow you to readily reconstruct the whole thing later on, don't care about the format)
	* Only write down “keywords”, not “sentences”
* Core Concept: Keep the process low-friction or even frictionless

What?

* an incomplete (or otherwise unsatisfactory) argument for a problem that you are working on
* an embarrassingly wrong piece of work
	* It is good to make a note of mistakes that one should avoid in the future (as an [Anti To-Do List](Variants%20of%20to-do%20list.md))

[Brainstorm/Insight Notebook by Tim Ferriss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFdR8w_R1HA)

* For thought-dumping (interesting goals and ideas)
* Multiple passes and constantly ask what did I think was important or cool through different times, so you're not just spewing onto the page and then forgetting it
	* 1st pass: when you first took notes
	* 2nd pass: maybe a week or a month after the note was taken; underscore ideas you find interesting at this time
	* 3rd pass: maybe a quarter after; encircle ideas you find interesting at this time

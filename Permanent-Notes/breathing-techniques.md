* Breath Counting
	* 默念：1, 2, 3, …
	* 默念：in, out, in, out, …
	* 默念：“Breathe in, my mind clears”, “Breathe out, my body relaxes”
	* 默念：“Relaxation flows in”, “Stress flows out”
* Breath Control ([Diaphragmatic/Belly/Abdominal Breathing](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/diaphragmatic-breathing))
	* Normal breathing is relatively _shallow_ and does not use the full capacity of the lungs. Diaphragmatic breathing is a _deep_ breathing exercise that fully engages the diaphragm and increases the efficiency of the lungs
	* Steps
		* Place one hand on the chest; place the other hand on the stomach
		* Breathe in through the nose; breath out through the mouse
			* Try inhaling **through your nose** and consciously **draw the air back**, parallel to the roof of your mouth—**not upward—since y**our **nasal cavity has more room backwards** than upwards. This subtle shift reflexively engages **deep diaphragmatic breathing**, which improves **oxygen efficiency**, supports **nervous system regulation**, and enhances **mental clarity** and **sleep quality**. Practicing this method **2–3 times daily** can help your body adopt it naturally during sleep.

		* Abdomen releases outwards when inhaling and expands inwards when exhaling
		* The chest remains still
* 142 高效呼吸法：一吸四憋二呼
	* 讓淋巴系統充分排除毒素
* Equal Breathing
	* Take a slow inhale through the nose that lasts for the count of 3
	* Exhale slowly through the nose for the whole count of 3
* Extended Exhaling
* [Box Breathing](https://sketchplanations.com/box-breathing): inhale-hold-exhale-hold
	* Count to 4 and slowly inhale.
	* Count to 4 and hold your breath.
	* Count to 4 and slowly exhale.
	* Count to 4 until you inhale again.
* The Lion’s Breath Technique
	* Sit in a comfortable position with a slight forward lean and your hands on the floor
	* Focus your gaze on the tip of your nose
	* Inhale deeply through your nose
	* Open your mouth, stick your tongue out and down to your chin
	* Exhale forcefully with a “HA!” sound. Note: Limit the forcefulness of the exhale if you’re a beginner.
	* Repeat 2-3x
* The 4-7-8 Breath Technique
	1. Inhale through your nose for a 4-second count
	2. Hold your breath for a 7-second count
	3. Exhale through your mouse for an 8-second count, making a “whoosh” sound through placing the tip of your tongue on the ridge behind your upper front teeth.
	4. Repeat 3–5 times.
* The Physiological (Mindful) Sigh (to reduce stress, promote relaxation, improve sleep, lower resting heart rate, stay in or return to a calmer state, and enhance mood)
	* Double-inhale through your nose (with no exhale in between!), to maximally inflate your lungs
		* 1 deep inhale through the nose
		* 1 short inhale to top up
	* Long exhale through your mouth until you are lungs-empty (to offload the max amount of CO2)
	* Repeat 2–3 cycles
* The Cyclic Hyperventilation (to increase alertness and enhance focus)
	* Take a deep inhale through the nose, immediately followed by a deep exhale (active or passive) through the mouth
	* Repeat 25x, then fully exhale until lungs are empty and hold for 15-30 seconds

我們的身體有兩套自主（或自律）神經系統：

1. 負責「戰或逃（Fight or Flight）」的交感神經，使我們感到緊張、警覺。
2. 負責「休息與消化（Rest and Digest）」的副交感神經，使我們感到安全、放鬆。

當我們處於壓力狀態時，「交感神經」會被啟動，心跳加速、肌肉緊繃。而緩慢、深沉的呼吸，可以快速將自己引導回「副交感神經」模式中。

以下是兩種我常用的呼吸法：

# 4-7-8 呼吸法

這個方法由 [Andrew Weil](https://www.drweil.com/videos-features/videos/breathing-exercises-4-7-8-breath/) 博士推廣，能幫助身體快速放鬆，甚至有助於睡眠：

1. **吸氣（4 秒）:** 用鼻子緩緩吸氣，默數 4 秒。
2. **憋氣（7 秒）:** 屏住呼吸，默數 7 秒。
3. **吐氣（8 秒）:** 用嘴巴緩緩吐氣，持續 8 秒。
4. 重複 3–5 次，就能感覺到身心明顯平靜下來。

# 箱式呼吸法（Box Breathing）

這是美國海豹部隊用來在壓力下保持冷靜的技巧：

1. **吸氣（4 秒）:** 用鼻子緩緩吸氣，默數 4 秒。
2. **憋氣（4 秒）:** 屏住呼吸，默數 4 秒。
3. **吐氣（4 秒）:** 用嘴巴緩緩吐氣，默數 4 秒。
4. **憋氣（4 秒）:** 再次屏住呼吸，默數 4 秒。

[想像一個正方形，每個邊都是 4 秒](https://sketchplanations.com/box-breathing)，跟著節奏繞行，就能穩定心率，找回專注。

如果你想找個工具輔助，可以試試 [The Breathing App](https://www.thebreathing.app/)。它沒有任何多餘的設計，只專注於一件事：引導你呼吸。

無論多忙，你都值得一個「重新整理」的機會。現在就放下手邊任務，閉上眼，專注呼吸一分鐘。這是隨時能送給自己的一份最好的禮物！

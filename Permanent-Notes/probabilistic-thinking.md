↔ Deterministic Thinking (絕對型思維)

---

is having a willingness to always ask questions like “_What else might happen?_”, “_What could happen next?_”, “_What if we’re wrong?_” and to look at the full range of possibilities that might come to pass rather than to assume that things will go as planned.

* Disconfirming Evidence — evidence that proves your existing ideas wrong — is exponentially more valuable than Confirming Evidence

# Think In Probabilities, Not Certainties

* Instead of saying “X will happen,” say, “There’s a 70% chance X will happen.”
* Don’t get attached to one “hand”—fold when odds don’t justify playing.

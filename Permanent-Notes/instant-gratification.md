# Pro Tips \& Personal Rules

* [Make it a personal rule to never watch TV on your own—“It has to be a social activity, otherwise I'm not going to do it.”](https://aliabdaal.com/newsletter/my-rule-for-watching-tv/)
* [Only enjoy desserts or sweets when sharing them with others—no indulging alone.](https://chengweihu.com/rules/)
* Instead of mindlessly indulging in activities like playing video games or watching TV, schedule [^4] them into your calendar with [forethought](Planning%20and%20preparation%20help%20maximize%20your%20productivity.md) and [intention](intentional-living.md). By planning these moments, you can enjoy them guilt-free, knowing they are part of your [recovery](rest,%20reset,%20relax,%20recharge.md) routine. The time you _plan_ to relax is never wasted. The time you _enjoy_ wasting is not a waste of time. Downtime deserves [time management](Time%20Management.md) too.

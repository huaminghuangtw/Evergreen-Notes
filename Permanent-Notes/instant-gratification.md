[Committing time to what’s best for you in the long run (like studying or exercising) is often unsatisfying in the short run, but people are wired to overvalue short-term rewards.](https://characterlab.org/tips-of-the-week/temptation-bundling/)

* 比起長遠的利益，我們 (未經訓練) 的大腦更偏好馬上就可以得到的快樂和感官享受 (Sensory Pleasures) [^1]
	* 慾望滿足 → 大腦獎賞機制 → 多巴胺分泌 → 上癮
* **Sigmund Freud’s Pleasure Principle:** The nature of human motivation is [pursuing pleasure](dopamine.md) and avoiding pain (i.e., the desire to stay in the comfort zone; to escape the discomfort).
* Our brains are optimized for [energy efficiency](energy-management.md), and they only turn on the CPU (Consciousness Processing Unit) when absolutely necessary

我們經常從「[壞習慣](be-a-habit-and-routine-machine.md)」中獲得「立刻」的滿足，而且當下或短期內並不會產生任何明顯的負面效果，這導致人們常常放任自己、沉溺在壞習慣當中。

* Doomscrolling (= Idle Scrolling = Zombie Scrolling) on [social media](Quit%20social%20media.md) [^2]
* Playing video games [^2]
* Binge-watching TV, Netflix series, or YouTube videos [^2]

# Pro Tips \& Personal Rules

* [Make it a personal rule to never watch TV on your own—“It has to be a social activity, otherwise I'm not going to do it.”](https://aliabdaal.com/newsletter/my-rule-for-watching-tv/)
* [Only enjoy desserts or sweets when sharing them with others—no indulging alone.](https://chengweihu.com/rules/)
* Instead of mindlessly indulging in activities like playing video games or watching TV, schedule [^4] them into your calendar with [forethought](planning-and-preparation-help-maximize-your-productivity.md) and [intention](intentional-living.md). By planning these moments, you can enjoy them guilt-free, knowing they are part of your [recovery](the-most-productive-people-prioritize-intentional-rest.md) routine. The time you _plan_ to relax is never wasted. The time you _enjoy_ wasting is not a waste of time. Downtime deserves [time management](Time%20Management.md) too.

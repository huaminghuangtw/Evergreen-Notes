Inequality, Everywhere

Don’t sweat the small stuff. Don’t major in minor things. Learn to differentiate the majors and the minors.

[There are also many situations in which it makes tactical sense to defer, delay, delegate, or procrastinate on any given task, and go work on something else instead in the meantime; not everything is equally important, and also a given task may in fact become much easier (and be completed in a much better way) if one waits for one’s own skills to get stronger, or for other events to happen that reduce the importance or need for the task in the first place.](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/batch-low-intensity-tasks-together/)

# Frameworks To Prioritize Daily Tasks

* The 3-3-3 Method by Oliver Burkeman
	* Spend 3 hours on your most important thing
	* Complete 3 shorter tasks you’ve been avoiding
	* Work on 3 maintenance activities to keep life in order
* The 1-3-5 Rule
	* 1 major task that has significant impact or is a top priority
	* 3 medium tasks that are important but not as critical as the major task
	* 5 small tasks that are relatively easy to complete and often quicker
* The 1-2-3 Rule
	* 1 Most Important Task
	* 2 Important \& Urgent Tasks

["Life Is Short" by Paul Graham](https://paulgraham.com/vb.html)

> _Life is short and finite. Don’t take things for granted. Appreciate every day. When you take things for granted, they’re gone.—You think you can always write that book, or climb that mountain, or whatever, and then you realize the window has closed. The saddest windows close when other people die.—Their lives are short too._

> _Relentlessly prune bullshit, don’t wait to do things that matter and important to you, and savor the time you have. That’s what you do when life is short._

---

We often hear “Life is short, enjoy it.”, but often forget: “Eternity is long, prepare for it.”

---

Accept the impermanence of everything in our lives.

> _The universe is vast and humans are insignificant in comparison._
> _Our existence is fleeting and our actions have limited impact._
> _Ultimately, everything we do and create will fade away._

* You won’t know when it’s the last time. But you can live like it is.
* Live each day as it were your last, because someday you’ll certainly be right.
* Try to live each day as if you’ve come back from the future, as if it was the final full day of your extraordinary, ordinary life.

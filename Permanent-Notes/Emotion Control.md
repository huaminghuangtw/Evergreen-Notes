Emotional strength isn't about getting rid of difficult feelings — it means you know how to [respond](choose-your-response.md) to them in a healthy way — focus your [attention](attention.md) on the actions that you can take to address your emotion, not the emotion itself. It's not about managing your emotions; it's about managing your response to your emotions.

Standing up for yourself without getting emotionally worked up (uptight).

Give yourself a fixed amount of time (~24 hours) to feel frustrated or [angry](anger.md) about the [failure](Failing%20forward%20turns%20setbacks%20into%20stepping%20stones.md). During this time, you don't need to do anything but [sit with the feelings and emotions](Acceptance%20and%20Commitment%20Therapy.md). Allow yourself the grace of that period, but when the time is up, you move forward to study and start to _learn_ from the failure. Don't inflate the size of the failure in your mind—_most failures are micro details, not macro issues._

Think of your mind as a train station platform. Emotions—anxiety, anger, sadness, etc.—are like trains constantly passing through, each heading to a different destination. [The ideal approach is to stay on the platform when you recognize an emotional train you'd rather not take. You observe it, acknowledge it, but choose not to board.](Acceptance%20and%20Commitment%20Therapy.md)

But often, despite our best efforts, we find ourselves on the train before we even realize it. And that's okay—we're human. We get [triggered](choose-your-response.md), we get frustrated. What matters most is [awareness](mastering-yourself-is-superpower.md). First, recognize when you've stepped onto the wrong train. Then, practice getting off before it takes you too far. Practice long enough, and the rides will become shorter. Eventually, you'll develop the ability to stay grounded—mindfully choosing which trains are worth the journey.

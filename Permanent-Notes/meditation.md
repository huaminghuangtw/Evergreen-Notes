# Eckhart Tolle

* “Enlightenment [^1] is the space between your thoughts.”
	* It's _not what we think but what happens in between_ that brings us peace.
	* Enlightenment isn't this thing you achieve after 30 years, sitting in a corner on a mountain top. It's something you can achieve moment to moment and you can be certain percentage enlightened every single day.
* “So the single most vital step on your journey toward enlightenment is this: learn to dis-identify from your mind. Every time you create a gap in the stream of mind, the light of your consciousness grows stronger. One day you may catch yourself smiling at the voice in your head, as you would smile at the antics of a child. This means that you no longer take the content of your mind all that seriously, as your sense of self does not depend on it.”

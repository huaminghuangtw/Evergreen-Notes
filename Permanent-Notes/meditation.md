> “Meditation is all about the pursuit of nothingness. It’s like the ultimate rest. It’s better than the best sleep you’ve ever had. It’s a quieting of the mind. It sharpens everything, especially your appreciation of your surroundings. It keeps life fresh.” — Hugh Jackman

> “Meditation is to be aware of what is going on: in your body, in your feelings, in your mind, and in the world.” — Thích Nhất Hạnh

> “Meditation is not about stopping thoughts, but recognizing that we are more than our thoughts and our feelings.” — Arianna Huffington

> “Meditation is the way in which we come to feel our basic inseparability from the whole universe.” — Alan Watts

「靜/淨心」的意思是讓心靈平靜安寧，是一種透過觀察內在或透過特定練習（如靜坐、冥想）來讓思緒沉澱、情緒放鬆的狀態。這種半夢半醒的潛意識狀態是為了與自己更深層地連結，培養覺知，並從壓力和紛擾中獲得寧靜。

# [Eckhart Tolle](https://www.google.com/search?q=Eckhart+Tolle)

* “Enlightenment [^1] is the space between your thoughts.”
	* It’s _not what we think but what happens in between_ that brings us peace.
	* Enlightenment isn’t this thing you achieve after 30 years, sitting in a corner on a mountain top. It’s something you can achieve moment to moment and you can be certain percentage enlightened every single day.
* “So the single most vital step on your journey toward enlightenment is this: learn to dis-identify from your mind. Every time you create a gap in the stream of mind, the light of your consciousness grows stronger. One day you may catch yourself smiling at the voice in your head, as you would smile at the antics of a child. This means that you no longer take the content of your mind all that seriously, as your sense of self does not depend on it.”

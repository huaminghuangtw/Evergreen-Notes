> _[“Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best of which you are capable. And you're the only one that will know that.” — John Wooden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWQIxuNGdvQ&t=95s)_

> _“Success is not how high you have climbed, but how you make a positive difference to the world.” — Roy T. Bennett_

> _“To laugh often and much: To win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children, to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate beauty, to find the best in others, to leave the world a bit better whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; to know even one life has breathed easier because you lived. This is to have succeeded.” — Ralph Waldo Emerson_

> _“To live content with small means. To seek elegance rather than luxury, and refinement rather than fashion. To be worthy not respectable, and wealthy not rich. To study hard, think quietly, talk gently, act frankly, to listen to stars, birds, babes, and sages with open heart, to bear all cheerfully, do all bravely, await occasions, hurry never. In a word, to let the spiritual, unbidden and unconscious, grow up through the common. This is to be my symphony.” — William Ellery Channing_

> _[“Success is having everything you need and doing everything you want. It is not doing everything you need to have everything you want.” — Jacob Lund Fisker](https://earlyretirementextreme.com/manifesto.html)_

> _[“Extreme success is not going to make you happy. In fact, success amplifies who you already are and how you already feel.” — Mark Manson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZJpU43NA0c&t=10m49s)_

> _[“Success in life is not for those who run fast, but for those who keep running and always on the move.” — Bangambiki Habyarimana, Pearls Of Eternity](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7890685-success-in-life-is-not-for-those-who-run-fast)_

> _“Success is being excited to go to work and being excited to come home.” — Will Ahmed_

> _[“He has achieved success who has worked well, laughed often, and loved much.” — Elbert Hubbard](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/elbert_hubbard_103488)_

> _[“Real success is success with self. It’s not in having things, but in having mastery, having victory over self.” — Anwar Sadat](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/856603)_

> _[“The ultimate success metric is whether you get what you want out of life. But that’s harder than it sounds because it’s easy to try to copy someone who wants something you don’t.” — Morgan Housel](https://collabfund.com/blog/your-way-is-the-only-way/)_

> _“Redefine success. The most meaningful form of performance is progress. The ultimate mark of potential is not the height of the peak you’ve reached, but the distance you’ve traveled—and helped others travel.” ― Adam M. Grant, [Hidden Potential: The Science of Achieving Greater Things](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/170223349)_

> _“Success isn’t about how your life looks to others. It’s about how it feels to you.” — Michelle Obama_

> _[“Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?' Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.” ― Marianne Williamson, A Return to Love: Reflections on the Principles of “A Course in Miracles”](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/928-our-deepest-fear-is-not-that-we-are-inadequate-our)_

「我們最大的恐懼，並非自己不夠好，而是遠比想像中更強大。我們最怕的不是失敗，而是做自己的成功。」[^3]

> _[“Over the years, I have come to realize that the greatest trap in our life is not success, popularity, or power, but self-rejection. Success, popularity, and power can indeed present a great temptation, but their seductive quality often comes from the way they are part of the much larger temptation to self-rejection. When we have come to believe in the voices that call us worthless and unlovable, then success, popularity, and power are easily perceived as attractive solutions. The real trap, however, is self-rejection. As soon as someone accuses me or criticizes me, as soon as I am rejected, left alone, or abandoned, I find myself thinking, "Well, that proves once again that I am a nobody." ... [My dark side says,] I am no good... I deserve to be pushed aside, forgotten, rejected, and abandoned. Self-rejection is the greatest enemy of the spiritual life because it contradicts the sacred voice that calls us the "Beloved." Being the Beloved constitutes the core truth of our existence.” — Henri J.M. Nouwen](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/230436-over-the-years-i-have-come-to-realize-that-the)_

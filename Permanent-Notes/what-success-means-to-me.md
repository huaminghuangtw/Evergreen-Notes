> “The road to success is always under construction.” — Steve Harvey

> [“Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best of which you are capable. And you’re the only one that will know that.” — John Wooden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWQIxuNGdvQ&t=95s)

> “Success is not how high you have climbed, but how you make a positive difference to the world.” — Roy T. Bennett

> “To laugh often and much: To win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children, to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate beauty, to find the best in others, to leave the world a bit better whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; to know even one life has breathed easier because you lived. This is to have succeeded.” — Ralph Waldo Emerson

> “To live content with small means. To seek elegance rather than luxury, and refinement rather than fashion. To be worthy not respectable, and wealthy not rich. To study hard, think quietly, talk gently, act frankly, to listen to stars, birds, babes, and sages with open heart, to bear all cheerfully, do all bravely, await occasions, hurry never. In a word, to let the spiritual, unbidden and unconscious, grow up through the common. This is to be my symphony.” — William Ellery Channing

> [“Success is having everything you need and doing everything you want. It is not doing everything you need to have everything you want.” — Jacob Lund Fisker](https://earlyretirementextreme.com/manifesto.html)

> [“Extreme success is not going to make you happy. In fact, success amplifies who you already are and how you already feel.” — Mark Manson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZJpU43NA0c&t=10m49s)

> [“Success in life is not for those who run fast, but for those who keep running and always on the move.” — Bangambiki Habyarimana, Pearls Of Eternity](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7890685-success-in-life-is-not-for-those-who-run-fast)

> “Success is being excited to go to work and being excited to come home.” — Will Ahmed

> [“He has achieved success who has worked well, laughed often, and loved much.” — Elbert Hubbard](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/elbert_hubbard_103488)

> [“Real success is success with self. It’s not in having things, but in having mastery, having victory over self.” — Anwar Sadat](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/856603)

> [“The ultimate success metric is whether you get what you want out of life. But that’s harder than it sounds because it’s easy to try to copy someone who wants something you don’t.” — Morgan Housel](https://collabfund.com/blog/your-way-is-the-only-way/)

> “Redefine success. The most meaningful form of performance is progress. The ultimate mark of potential is not the height of the peak you’ve reached, but the distance you’ve traveled—and helped others travel.” — Adam M. Grant, [Hidden Potential: The Science of Achieving Greater Things](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/170223349)

> “Success isn’t about how your life looks to others. It’s about how it feels to you.” — Michelle Obama

> [“The difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength, not a lack of knowledge, but rather a lack in will.” — Vince Lombardi](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/93874-the-difference-between-a-successful-person-and-others-is-not)

> “Success is doing what you want to do, when you want, where you want, with whom you want, as much as you want.” — Tony Robbins

# [“The Inner Ring” by C.S. Lewis](https://www.lewissociety.org/innerring/) [^1]

> [As long as you are governed by that desire you will never get what you want.](the-arrival-fallacy.md) You are trying to peel an onion; if you succeed there will be nothing left. Until you conquer the fear of being an outsider, an outsider you will remain.” [^2]

> 我曾經有過許許多多的夢想，但是我更想要成功，我常在夢想和現實中擺盪著。在一次又一次的失敗後，我告訴自己不要為世俗定義的「成功」而活，要爲自己真正相信的 [眞理](seek-for-the-truth.md) 而活。不要只想當個出鋒頭的英雄，要學習當個配角，一個傾聽者，積極追隨許多前行者完成夢想，也積極幫助需要幫助的年輕人實現理想。我的故事將從我的 [失敗經驗](failing-forward-turns-setbacks-into-stepping-stones.md) 開始。當我能完全臣服於自己的失敗，洞穿了自己的脆弱和不足之後，反而成為一個完整可愛的平凡普通人。這是這些年我越來越清楚的事情。

The most important thing in life is _not having_ what you want, but _knowing_ what you want—figuring it out is everything!

[Life is a game of awareness and action: Awareness to understand something’s importance and action to execute on that importance.](https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/11-uncommon-lessons-from-uncommon-minds)

> “I think in terms of the day’s resolutions, not the years’.” — Henry Moore

1. Define you [VALUES](why-we-exist.md) (\& ditch unrealistic big goals)
2. Focus on today’s [ACTIONS](cultivate-a-strong-bias-towards-action.md) (instead of a 5, 10, 15-year plan) that will compound positively towards the future you desire.

	> You won’t change your life _in a day_, but if you change your days, you’ll eventually change your life. You don’t plan your future. You plan your actions _today_, and those actions create your future. Planning your future can quickly spiral into procrastination in disguise. Focus on the actions in the present and let the future take care of itself.

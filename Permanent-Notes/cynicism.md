= 犬儒主義 = 憤世忌俗

Rooted in a belief that the world or people are inherently flawed or corrupt.

Seeks to protect from disappointment by assuming the worst or believing the world operates through ulterior motives.

Feels good simply by portraying others as worse.

Many seek self-esteem not in their own abilities, but in other’s failures.

> If I tell myself that ‘everything is shit’ or that ‘things will never get better’, then I am excused of ever having to try at anything.

> The upside of never trying is never having to feel the pain of failure.

> It’s more comfortable to get fatalistic and call it pragmatism.

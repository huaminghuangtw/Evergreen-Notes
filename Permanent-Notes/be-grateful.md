Author [Kurt Vonnegut](https://www.google.com/search?q=Kurt+Vonnegut) in [1998 commencement speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr11hM6CLeo&t=8m38s) at [Rice University](https://versailles1.tripod.com/rice.html):

> _One thing which Uncle Alex found objectionable about human beings was that they seldom took time out to notice when they were happy. He himself did his best to acknowledge it when times were sweet. We could be drinking lemonade in the shade of an apple tree in the summertime, and he would interrupt the conversation to say, **“If this isn’t nice, what is?”**_
>
> _So, I hope that you Adams and Eves in front of me will do the same for the rest of your lives. When things are going sweetly and peacefully, please pause a moment, and then say out loud: “If this isn’t nice, what is?” Hold up your hands if you promise to do that._

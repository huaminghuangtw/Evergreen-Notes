If you were truly living your ideal, dream, and [fulfilling](why-we-exist.md) life on your own terms, in a way you want, I don’t think you really fear death. Why? First, you would be too busy living. Second, you don’t have any regrets.” — Naval Ravikant_

Mortality

---

Live for death.

---

Death is scary. It’s uncomfortable to think about. So we tend to avoid it. But when we use it as a frame of reference like this, it can be a powerful tool for clarity. Internalize the scarcity of life and certainty/inescapability of death.

---

Death is the ultimate equalizer. We may look different, live in different places, and believe different things, but in the end, we are all the same.

唯有死亡等在路的盡頭，才能顯得出每個人活著的不同意義。人並不是因為死亡逼近了才會去想死亡，人在很小的時候就會知覺到生命是會消逝的，通常那就是長大成熟的開始，也是 [自覺](mastering-yourself-is-superpower.md) 的起點。

# 最大化快樂/體驗，[最小化後悔/遺憾](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwG_qR6XmDQ) [^1]

* Don’t be on your deathbed someday, having squandered your one chance at life, full of regret because you pursued little distractions instead of big dreams.
* [“The Dash” by Linda Ellis](https://100.best-poems.net/dash.html)
* _“We don’t beat the reaper by living longer, but by living well, and living fully — for the reaper will come for all of us. The question is: what do we do between the time we’re born and the time he shows up. Because when he shows up, it’s too late to do all the things that you always wanted to get around to. It is not the things we do in life that we regret on our deathbed. It is the things we do not.” — Randy Pausch_

# [Bronnie Ware's “Top Five Regrets of the Dying”](https://bronnieware.com/regrets-of-the-dying/)

**What people most often regret before they die (Deathbed Regret):** [^2]

1. I wish I had the courage to live a life true to myself, not trying to a people pleaser and lived the life others expected of me.
2. I wish I didn’t work so hard. [^3]
3. I wish I had the courage to express my feelings.
4. I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.
5. I wish that I had let myself be happier.

To avoid these mistakes, [Paul Graham](https://paulgraham.com/todo.html) inverted the regrets to five commands:

1. Don’t ignore your dreams
2. Don’t work too much
3. Say what you think
4. Cultivate friendships
5. Be happy

Takeaway: [The biggest regrets aren't about _failing_; they're about _not trying at all_.](https://youtu.be/RcYv5x6gZTA) No one ever said: “_I wish I hadn’t tried so many things._” or “_I wish I hadn’t been so adventurous with my life._” on their deathbed. More often than not, people regret the chances they didn’t take, the dreams they set aside, and the experiences they were too afraid to pursue.

Remarks: Through history, people have gone back into their own pasts, sometime to a precious, unstructured time in their life, and often, the mind gravitates in the past to a moment of shame, some sin of anger/self-pity committed, some act of selfishness, an act of omission/shallowness, a lack of courage.

# 生前喪禮 (Living Funnel)

* As long as there is [love](love.md), there will be grief, because grief is love’s natural continuation. Don’t fear sadness of loss, as it tends to sit right next to the joy.
* [It's not about knowing what to say. It's about being there when nobody knows what to say. The only thing people need to hear is, "You are not alone." And that doesn't require words. It just requires your presence.](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/february-6-2025)

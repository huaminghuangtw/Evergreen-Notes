> _“The resting place of the mind is the heart. The only thing the mind hears all day is clanging bells and noise and argument, and all it wants is quietude. The only place the mind will ever find peace is inside the silence of the heart. That’s where you need to go.” — Elizabeth Gilbert_

> _“Don’t let the behavior of others destroy your inner peace.” — Dalai Lama_

> _“I’m here to tell you that the path to peace is right there, when you want to get away.” — Pema Chodron_

Peace is not merely a distant goal that we seek, but a means by which we arrive at that goal.

Not having the urge to explain or defend yourself is real inner peace.

The Japanese word [mushin (無心)](https://www.google.com/search?q=mushin) translates to “no mind” or “empty mind.” It describes a mental state central to Zen Buddhism and Japanese martial arts, where the mind is free from [anger](anger.md), [fear](fear.md), and [ego](abandon-your-ego.md). This state isn’t a complete absence of thought but rather a fluid, unencumbered awareness—free from attachment, conceptual [overthinking](overthinking.md), or [fixation on thoughts](be-ready-to-change-your-mind-completely-at-any-given-time.md).

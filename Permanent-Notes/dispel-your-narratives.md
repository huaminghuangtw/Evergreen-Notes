Things are rarely as wonderful as you imagine, nor as terrible as you fear.

It’s easy to label things as “good” or “bad” in the moment, but the truth is, we rarely know how things will play out in the long run.

The wisest among us allow events to exist without applying a narrative layer. They let the space for the events to just exist, to be neither good nor bad—to just be, rather than place judgment on each reality—whether something is [“good” or “bad”](duality-vs-polarity.md).

[接受這個世界自然運行的樣貌：當你因為外在事物而痛苦，折磨你的並非事物本身，而是你對事物的評價。其實，你是有能力立刻拋開這些評價的。訓練自己面對事物時，內心不產生意見、靈魂不為之躁動，都是我們能力所及的事；因為，事物天生並不具備讓我們產生意見的能力。](https://readingoutpost.com/meditations/)

拋棄對每一件事物「正面或負面」的評價，接受他們的本質，就像樂曲裡的「高音或低音」— 沒有絕對的「對或錯」、「好或壞」。

See things objectively. [See things the way they truly are](seek-for-the-truth.md), not the way you wish they were, and be in harmony with those things.

Don’t rush to label events as “good” or “bad.”
Life unfolds in ways you can’t predict.

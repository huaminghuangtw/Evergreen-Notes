It’s easy to label things as “good” or “bad” in the moment, but the truth is, we rarely know how things will play out in the long run.

The wisest among us allow events to exist without applying a narrative layer. They let the space for the events to just exist, to be neither good nor bad—to just be, rather than place judgment on each reality—whether something is [“good” or “bad”](Duality%20versus%20Polarity.md).

[The ability to _observe without evaluating_ is the highest form of intelligence.](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuotesPorn/comments/usvq74/the_ability_to_observe_without_evaluating_is_the/) — Like children, their life goes without saying: whether it is good or bad makes no difference. This is because children don’t see the world, don’t observe the world, don’t contemplate the world, but are so deeply immersed in the world that they don’t distinguish between it and their own selves.

[接受這個世界自然運行的樣貌：當你因為外在事物而痛苦，折磨你的並非事物本身，而是你對事物的評價。其實，你是有能力立刻拋開這些評價的。訓練自己面對事物時，內心不產生意見、靈魂不為之躁動，都是我們能力所及的事；因為，事物天生並不具備讓我們產生意見的能力。](https://readingoutpost.com/meditations/)

拋棄對每一件事物「正面或負面」的評價，接受他們的本質，就像樂曲裡的「高音或低音」— 沒有絕對的「對或錯」、「好或壞」。

See things objectively. [See things the way they truly are](Seek%20for%20the%20truth.md), not the way you wish they were, and be in harmony with those things.

# The Parable of the Chinese Farmer

A farmer and his son had a beloved horse who helped the family earn a living. One day, the horse ran away and their neighbors exclaimed, “Your horse ran away, what terrible luck!” The farmer replied, “Maybe so, maybe not.”

A few days later, the horse returned home, leading a few wild horses back to the farm as well. The neighbors shouted out, “Your horse has returned, and brought several horses home with him. What great luck!” The farmer replied, “Maybe so, maybe not.”

Later that week, the farmer’s son was trying to break one of the horses, and it threw him to the ground, breaking his leg. The neighbors cried, “Your son broke his leg, what terrible luck!” The farmer replied, “Maybe so, maybe not.”

A few weeks later, soldiers from the national army marched through town, recruiting all boys for the army. They did not take the farmer’s son, because he had a broken leg. The neighbors shouted, “Your boy is spared, what tremendous luck!” To which the farmer replied, “Maybe so, maybe not. We’ll see.”

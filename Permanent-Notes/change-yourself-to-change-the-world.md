[Your entire life will change the day you realize that everything is on you. No one is coming to save you. No one will fix your problems. No one can act on your behalf. No one will change your mindsets. No one will hand you the things you want in life. It’s the acceptance that you have to hunt if you want to eat. It’s all on you.](https://x.com/SahilBloom/status/1855607589578453496)

Self-reliance is the ultimate source of strength. Self-help is the best help.

# It’s A Lot Easier To Change Yourself Than To Change The World. Be The Change You Want To See In The World.

* Water your own grass
* Mow your own lawn

Tend your garden. Sow your seeds. Water your grass. The grass is greener where you water it.

Personal development/growth/improvement is a lifelong endeavor. Every single day, you have to [act in favor of the person you want to become](your-identity-dictates-your-actions.md).

# Set Your House In Perfect Order Before You Criticize The World. (在批評世界之前，先把房間整理乾淨)

[@peterson12RulesLife2018]

* Your house is a metaphor for YOU. Unless you are perfect, 99% of the time the solution to your problem is not “out there” but “in here.”

# You Should Spend More Time In Your _Circle Of Influence_ And Less Time In Your _Circle Of Concern_.

![](../_attachments/399f5eabbf33dfe8f8505b21847b81d5.png)

* Based on these two circles, **reactive** people will think more about the **circle of concern** while **proactive** people focus more on the **circle of influence**.
* Your Circle of Concern (關注圈) is all the things you worry about and that influence you but that you have no control over: Federal Government, climate change, etc.
* Your Circle of Influence (影響圈) is all the things you can control: your actions, your habits, your attitudes, your attention, etc.
* **The more you focus on your Circle of Influence, the bigger your Circle of Influence will get, and the more you can accomplish to help fix things in your Circle of Concern.**

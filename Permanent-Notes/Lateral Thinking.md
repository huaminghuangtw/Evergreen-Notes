> _“The young man knows the rules, but the old man knows the exceptions.” — Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr._

> _“The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.” ― George Bernard Shaw_

> _“Learn the rules like a pro, so you can break them like an artist.”_

> _“I learned over the years that people don’t argue with rules. We’ve been taught our whole lives to follow the rules, but we’ve never thought of how to create rules for ourselves that we just follow when we’re at our worst. We all know no matter how bad our day is, we shouldn’t speed on the highway because it’s against the rules. What we don’t think about is how do we use rules to our advantage?” — Daniel Kahneman_

* Don’t follow the rules/crowd. Break the rule/frame.
* Rule Follower → Rule Breaker
* Break the rules with intention, not ignorance.
* Create rules that change the rules.
* Beat the game, not play the game.

反直覺式思考: Think differently. Think out of the box.

Reality is largely negotiable. If you stress-test the boundaries and experiment with the “impossibles,” you’ll quickly discover that most limitations are a fragile collection of socially reinforced rules you can choose to break at any time.

The 3 Stages of Mastery: The Shu Ha Ri model from traditional Japanese martial arts

1. Shu (to obey): Learn to operate according to the rules.
2. Ha (to break): Begin to challenge and adapt the rules.
3. Ri (to transcend): Create new rules.

Cutting the [Gordian knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordian_Knot) (快刀斬亂麻)

> **Am I trying to untie something I could just cut through?**

Functional fixedness is a cognitive bias where a person is unable to see something outside of its traditional or intended function.

In the case of the Gordian Knot, the fixed assumption was simple:

A knot must be untied.

The fixed assumption defined and limited the options of those attempting to solve the problem.

Rather than being trapped, Alexander challenged the fixed assumption—metaphorically (and literally) cutting straight through it.

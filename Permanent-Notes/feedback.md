# On Giving Feedback

## Principles

1. Make it shorter.
2. Make it more appealing.
3. Make it general → “_How could it apply to more people?”_

To give feedback, first make the other person feel you care about them.

Criticism Sandwich — 善用「先稱讚，再建議」的順序

* First praise the person for something, then deliver the criticism, and then close with topic-shifting praise to exit the sensitive topic.
* Example:

> **You:** Hi, Mara. Do you have a second?
>
> **Mara:** Sure. What's up?
>
> **You:** _First, I wanted to thank you for_ helping me with the Meelie Worm account [or whatever]. _I really appreciate_ you showing me how to handle that. _You're really good_ at fixing the technical issues.
>
> **Mara:** No problem.
>
> **You:** _Here's the thing_. [^1] There is a lot of work coming down on everyone, and _I'm feeling_ [^2] a bit overwhelmed. _Normally, priorities are really clear to me_ ,[^3] but I've been having trouble recently figuring out which tasks are highest on the list. _Could you help me_ by pointing out the most important items when a handful need to be done? _I'm sure it's just me, but I'd really appreciate it, and I think it would help._
>
> **Mara:** Uhh … I'll see what I can do.
>
> **You:** _That means a lot to me. Thanks. Before I forget_ ,[^4] last week's presentation was excellent.
>
> **Mara:** Did you think so? Blah, blah, blah …

# On Receiving Feedback

When people hesitate to give you honest feedback, ask for a score from 0-10, instead of asking, “_What do you think?_”—which invites ambiguity. You'll rarely get a perfect 10, and this makes it easy to follow up with, “_What would make this closer to a 10?_” Better questions lead to better feedback—and faster growth.

避免抱持任何預設立場，永遠以「對方或許更接近真相」來思考（假設別人是對的，自己是錯的），甚至可以在對話/交流中這樣回應：

* 「我認為你觸及到核心問題了，請多說一些。」
* 「你的觀點似乎切中要害，能否再深入說明？」
* 「我覺得你點到關鍵了，可以再多分享一些嗎？」

[^1]: Don't call it a “problem” if you can avoid it.
[^2]: No one can argue with your feelings, so use this to avoid a debate about external circumstances.
[^3]: Take “you” out of the sentence to avoid finger-pointing → ~~“Normally, you make priorities clear.”~~
[^4]: “Before I forget” is a great segue to the closing compliment, which is also a topic shifter and gets you off the sensitive topic without awkwardness.

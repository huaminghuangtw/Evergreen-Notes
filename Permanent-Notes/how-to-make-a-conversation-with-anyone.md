# The Principles of Connected Conversation

* Principle 1: Create Doorknobs (that lead to a story rather than end the conversation)
* Principle 2: Be a Loud [Listener](Active%20Listening.md)
	* <u>Sounds</u>: Saying “yes” or “uh-huh” or “hmm” to signal listening and encourage continued energy from the speaker.
	* <u>Facial Expressions</u>: Changing facial expressions to react physically to the story being told.
	* <u>Body Language</u>: Forward lean posture towards the speaker signals engagement and positive energy. Never turn away or sideways, as it signals you are trying to leave a conversation and immediately hurts the energy of a moment.
* Principle 3: Repeat \& Follow
	* Repeating key points back to the speaker in your own words and following on with an additional insight, story, or doorknob.
	* Deliberately mirror their words by echoing the last one to three key terms they used; this simple gesture signals attentiveness and gently invites them to continue.
* Principle 4: Make Situational Eye Contact
	* Deep and connected while they speak.
	* Organic while you speak - It’s ok to gaze off while you think, but use eye contact to emphasize key points and moments in a story.

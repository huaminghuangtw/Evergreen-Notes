> [“I said empty your mind, be formless, shapeless — like water. Now, you put water in a cup, it becomes the cup; You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle; You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow, or it can crash. Be water, my friend.” — Bruce Lee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e78SV6EjTQg)

> “Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way round or through it. If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves.” — Bruce Lee

> “Don’t get set into one form, adapt it and build your own, and let it grow, be like water.” — Bruce Lee

> “Be like water; soft as it is, it breaks through rocks and impenetrable surfaces.” — Matshona Dhliwayo

> “I want to be like water. I want to slip through fingers, but hold up a ship.” — Michelle Williams

「Be Water，My Friend !」，意思是武者不被形式所拘，要像水一樣流動，既柔軟又剛強堅韌；既能適應萬物，又能匯聚為強大的力量。

當水被某種障礙物擋住時，它會平靜等待，卻又伺機而動；一旦移開障礙物，就會立刻奔流過去，毫不遲疑。所以，李小龍說，面對競爭與阻礙，「水，永遠都是放鬆卻做好準備的。」

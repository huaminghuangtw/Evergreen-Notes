# Perpetual Busyness: We’re in the midst of a global busyness crisis

* [The Busy Trap = The Rat Race](https://fs.blog/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/) — A treadmill to nowhere
	* = 瞎忙 = 窮忙 = 假勤奮 = 偽生產力 [^1]
* Often, we found there was a lot of _movement_, but _no forward progress_ (like a “[Rocking Horse](https://www.google.com/search?q=Rocking+Horse)” — always moving, but never going anywhere). [^2]
* 有時候，我們會覺得自己很忙，好像做了很多事，卻根本沒做出什麼明顯的成績。有行動，卻沒有成果。辛苦了老半天，結果卻回到原點，開始時和結束時的狀態都差不多，沒什麼進展。這正是 [「效率 (Efficient) 」與「效能 (Effective) 」](what-you-work-on-is-far-more-important-than-how-productively-you-work.md) 的關鍵區別。兩者看似相近，實則大不相同 — 如果方向錯了，即使做得再好，也只是徒勞無功。
* **Action:** Break the busyness cycle. Don’t fall into “The Efficiency Trap.”

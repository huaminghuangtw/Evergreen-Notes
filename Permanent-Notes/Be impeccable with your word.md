“Raise your words, not voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder.”

---

One useful word is better than a thousand useless words.

---

Always be aware of how you are using the word. Avoid using the word to [speak against yourself](be-careful-how-you-are-talking-to-yourself.md) or to [Never gossip about others](Never%20gossip%20about%20others.md) about others.

---

Some questions to consider before you speak:

 * _Does this need to be said?_
 * _Does this need to be said by me?_
 * _Does this need to be said by me right now?_

---

Before you speak, let your words pass through three gates:

1. _Is it true?_
2. _Is it necessary?_
3. _Is it kind?_

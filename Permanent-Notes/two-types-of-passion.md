# 1. Obsessive Passion

Obsessive Passion is rigid. Your entire identity becomes interconnected with the pursuit itself. Your self-worth attached to your extrinsic success in it. Rest periods away from the pursuit are viewed as a reward for your efforts, but often create feelings of guilt or shame. It is all-consuming.

The pursuit defines the life.

# 2. Harmonious Passion

Harmonious Passion is [adaptive](adaptability.md). It is chosen. It aligns with your [identity](your-identity-dictates-your-actions.md), but it does not supersede it. It is a reflection of your priorities and values. It is naturally energizing. [Rest periods away from the pursuit are viewed as an important part of your performance, not a reward for your efforts.](the-most-productive-people-prioritize-intentional-rest.md)

The life defines the pursuit.

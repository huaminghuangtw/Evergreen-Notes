# Definition

* A concept meaning “_inexertion_”, “_inaction_”, or “_effortless action_”
* A state of personal harmony and [free-flowing](flow-state.md)
* ≠ 什麼事都不做、整天無所事事
	* It doesn’t mean **inaction**, but rather **not forcing things unnaturally**. [Just as water flows best when unobstructed](be-like-water.md), life unfolds most harmoniously when we don’t constantly interfere.
* = 無為而治，不為自己的利益和欲望做事
	* 「取天下也，恆無事；及其有事也，不足以取天下。」
	* 「我無為而民自化，我好靜而民自正，我無事而民自富，我無欲而民自樸。」

* The drift of things; going with the [flow](flow-state.md). _It is the art of sailing, rather than rowing._
* The river is not pushed from behind, nor is it pulled from ahead. It falls with gravity.

Doing nothing can be surprisingly [productive](Productivity.md). I’ve experienced Wu Wei in my life when I’ve chosen not to immediately act on something, or simply do nothing and embrace laziness.

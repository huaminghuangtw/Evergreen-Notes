> _“Our culture has become hooked on the quick-fix, the life hack, efficiency. Everyone is on the hunt for that simple action algorithm that nets maximum profit with the least amount of effort. There’s no denying this attitude may get you some of the trappings of success, if you’re lucky, but it will not lead to a calloused mind or self-mastery. If you want to master the mind and remove your governor, you’ll have to become addicted to hard work. Because passion and obsession, even talent, are only useful tools if you have the work ethic to back them up.”_

> _[“The problem with smart people is they can come up with a good reason for not doing anything. They are smart enough to find the cracks, to foresee the challenges, and to talk themselves out of the idea. They are experts at justifying their lack of courage or lack of action with an intelligent excuse. But there will always be reasons to not do something, and this is particularly true of anything worth doing. We value those moments in which we overcame challenge, not those in which we avoided it. Ultimately, action is a choice. The choice to emphasize the reasons for doing it despite the reasons you have for avoiding it.” — James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/august-8-2024)_

Just Fucking Do It (#JFDI)!

* 先做再說

不做不知道，做了才知道，犯錯沒關係，輸得起就好。

The real gap is between doing nothing and doing something.

---

Creating more collisions and generating more data through motion.

Stop fearing the regret of action and start fearing the regret of inaction. The regret from inaction is always more painful than the regret from action. Nobody gets to their deathbed and says, “I’m sorry for trying so many things.”

---

It is easier to act yourself into a new way of thinking, than it is to think yourself into a new way of acting.

It’s also a lot easier to [change direction](adaptability.md) when you’re moving forward than when you’re static.

# Identify and close your **Say-Do Gap**

> _“Inaction breeds doubt and fear. Action breeds confidence and courage.” — Dale Carnegie_

Every single thing you want in life is on the other side of something you don’t want to do. The answers you seek are found in the actions you avoid.

* The body you seek is found in the workouts you avoid.
* The relationships you seek are found in the hard conversations you delay.
* The clarity you seek is found in the walks you skip.
* The purpose you seek is found in the focused work you neglect.
* The success you seek is found in the hours of execution you put off.

**What answers are hidden in the actions you avoid?**

# Later You’ll Be Dead.

One day, you’ll be gone. Life is full of ‘laters.’

* _I’ll spend more time with my kids later._
* _I’ll prioritize my health later._
* _I’ll create more freedom later._

But here’s the harsh truth: _later_ often means _never._ Most of the things you promise to do later won’t be possible by the time you get around to them.

* Your health won’t wait for you.
* Your kids won’t be five years old forever.
* Freedom and fulfillment won’t magically appear on their own.

Either design the life you want now—or be prepared to live with regret later. It’s never too late.

Later is the default mindset.

Later is the acceptance of your fate.

Later is where your dream life goes to die.

Later is the self-limiting word of the broken.

There is no later, because later you’ll be [dead](death.md).

# Stop Gathering More Information And Start Acting On The Information You Already Have.

> _“Wanting more information is often just a form of procrastination.” — Russ Roberts_

* Information is abundant, action is hard. Execution is everything.
* Ideas are easy. It’s the execution of ideas that really separates the sheep from the goats.
* EXECUTION is more important than the tactic itself.
* Solve the **“Knowledge”** problem first (by gathering information), then the **“Execution”** problem (by creating evidence pool).
	* But be aware of **The Information-Action Gap** (= The time lag between receiving information and acting on that information)
	* “If information isn’t nurtured with action, it loses its power.”
* Knowledge is as vital to life as air. Just as no one should be denied the right to breathe, knowledge should be freely accessible to all. Yet, like air that must be inhaled to sustain life, knowledge only becomes truly valuable when it is applied—mere possession is not enough.
* [Tutorial Hell](https://www.google.com/search?q=Tutorial+Hell) is a state of perpetual [learning](learning-is-the-single-best-investment-that-you-can-make-for-your-time.md), often marked by the consumption of one tutorial after another without putting acquired knowledge into practice.
	* How to master any skill fast?
		1. Stop studying
			* Most people get trapped in _tutorial hel_l and have nothing to show for years of “[learning](learning-is-the-single-best-investment-that-you-can-make-for-your-time.md).”
		2. Outline a project
		3. Start building it
		4. Hit a roadblock
		5. Research how to overcome it
		6. Repeat until completed

# Two Type of Priorities

1. **Stated Priorities:** Priorities that people say they have
2. **Demonstrated Priorities:** Priorities that people’s actions show they have

**If someone observed my actions for a week, what would they say my priorities are? Does my actions align with my intention?**

> _“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.” — [“The Man In The Arena” speech given by Theodore Roosevelt on April 23, 1910, in Paris, France](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A311CnTjfos)_

The line — from Theodore Roosevelt’s famous 1910 speech “[Citizenship in a Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_in_a_Republic)” (often called “The Man in the Arena” speech) — captures a timeless idea about courage, effort, and authenticity.

Roosevelt is saying that those who merely judge or comment from the sidelines — the critics, commentators, or spectators — do not truly matter in the grand scheme of things. It’s easy to stand back, point out mistakes, and explain what others should have done. But that kind of talk costs nothing.

In contrast, the person who actually steps into the arena — who tries, fails, struggles, and keeps going — is the one who deserves respect. The “strong man” in this passage represents the person who takes real action, who risks failure and criticism in pursuit of something meaningful.

Roosevelt’s deeper point is this:

* Effort matters more than [perfection](perfectionism.md).
* [Courage](courage-is-knowing-what-not-to-fear.md) matters more than comfort.
* Doing matters more than [judging](dispel-your-narratives.md).

# The Power of Tiny Actions

 Adapted from [Loren Eiseley’s “The Start Thrower / Starfish Story” (1969)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Star_Thrower)

> An old man was walking along the beach when he noticed a young boy picking up starfish and throwing them back into the ocean.
>
> Approaching the boy, he asked, “Excuse me, but what are you doing?”
>
> The boy replied, “The sun is rising and the tide is going out. If I don’t throw the starfish back in, they’ll die.”
>
> The old man shook his head and said, “But there’s too many starfish on this beach. You can’t possibly make a difference.”
>
> After thinking for a moment, the boy bent down, picked up another starfish and threw it into the ocean.
>
> Then, he turned to the old man and said, “Well, I made a difference to that one.”

> Those who wait for the perfect idea rarely move; those who act, even imperfectly, invite better ideas to emerge. [Open the door.](https://quarter--mile.com/Open-the-Door)

* Slack started as an internal chat tool for a video game that never took off.
* Twitter began as a side project within a company called Odeo.

Neither came from waiting for the perfect idea—they were born from action.

Avoid temptation rather than relying on willpower.

---

Never rely on strong willpower or overcoming resistance, but rather designing an environment that is flexible enough to avoid friction in the first place. Instead of struggling with adverse dynamics, highly productive people redirect obstacles, much like Judo champions do.

---

Try to use _the least amount_ of willpower for self-control or [self-discipline](discipline-equals-freedom.md). [Ask yourself the WHY](why-we-exist.md) instead.

---

Don’t rely solely on willpower to push through toward distant goals. Don’t just grit your teeth. If an activity doesn’t provide some [immediate gratification](instant-gratification.md), it’s hard to stay committed. Instead, try [bundling](temptation-bundling.md) your goals with enjoyable activities. Turning goal pursuit into something pleasurable is one of the most effective ways to make meaningful progress—and [enjoy the journey](journey-over-destination.md) along the way.

In the long-run (and often in the short-run), your willpower will never beat your environment. The more disciplined your environment is, the less disciplined you need to be. Don't swim upstream.

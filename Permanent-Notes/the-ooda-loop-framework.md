The OODA Loop is a decision-making framework developed by military strategist John Boyd.

This framework is intended to be iterative: the results of each step [feed back into the beginning of the loop](feedback-loop.md), informing subsequent iterations. This enables [continuous improvement](the-growth-mindset.md) and refinement of the [decision-making](decision-making.md) process.

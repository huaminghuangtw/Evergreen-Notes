= 自我覺察 (Self-awareness) ≈ Self-examination ≈ 後設認知 (Metacognition) = (對自己) 認知的認知

# 認識自己 → 接受自己 → 喜歡自己

自我覺察是一種能開啟與自己真誠的對話、和自己自在相處的能力。它必須建立對於「感覺」的敏感度上，這種敏銳的感知力，能讓人察覺自己的情緒、發覺自己的真實感受，並有能力對這種感覺做出回應。與自己對話很重要，當一個人不夠了解自己的時候，是很難喜歡自己的。反之，當一個人越了解自己，就越能接受「最真實」的自己，進而喜歡自己、改變自己。

[自我反省乍看之下很簡單，但其實極其困難而且急不得，因為人很擅長欺騙自己，又或是在當下會因為各種因素難以接受自己的真實想法。](https://www.parkerchang.life/life/2023-2024) [^2]

# 佛洛伊德

* **本我 (Id):** 人的本能
* **自我 (Ego):** 兩者衝突時的調節者
* **超我 (Superego):** 人的理想化目標

---

[@jamesPrinciplesPsychologyTwo1995] distinguished two understandings of the self, the self as “Me” and the self as “I”, in the context of consciousness.

* “Me” corresponds to the self as an object of experience (self as object)
* “I” reflects the self as a subject of experience (self as subject)

# [Master Shi Heng Yi – 5 hindrances to self-mastery](https://youtu.be/4-079YIasck) [^3]

* “_The universal law of being successful and happy at the same time means finding the balance._”
* _“There are 2 mistakes along the way to Mastery: Not starting it, and not going all the way.”_
* 5 Hindrances
	1. [Sensual desire](instant-gratification.md) (pleasures \& distractions)
		* from the five gates of the body:
			* Seeing
			* Hearing
			* Smelling
			* Tasting (口腹之慾)
			* Feeling
	2. [Ill-will (aversion & negative thoughts)](What%20to%20do%20when%20you%20have%20negative%20thoughts%20or%20emotions.md)
	3. Slothful body & mind (lack of energy/motivation, heaviness of body, dullness of mind)
	4. Restlessness (unsettled/monkey mind)
		* Regret about the past
		* Worry about the future
		* Unable to [stay in the present](live-in-the-present.md)
	5. [Skeptical doubt (indecisiveness)](overthinking.md)
* How to remove these hindrances?
	1. Recognize (what state of mind you're in)
	2. [Accept & Acknowledge](Acceptance%20and%20Commitment%20Therapy.md) (the situations and people to be the way as it is/they are)
		* Just let it rain
	3. Investigate (your emotional & mental state)
		* Observe the sensation and ask yourself:
			* _“Why did it come up?”_
			* _“What is the consequence if I remain in this state?”_
	4. Non-Identification (無我)
		* Practice “_I'm not the body, I'm not the mind, I'm not my emotion, I can just see all these 3 aspects about me._” [^4]

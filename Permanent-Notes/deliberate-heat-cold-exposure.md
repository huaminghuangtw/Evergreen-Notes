# Heat Exposure

* ≈ Thermotherapy
* Formats
	* Warm shower/baths
		* 泡澡本身就是一種溫和的排毒方式。因**皮膚是人體最大的排毒器官**，透過熱水開啟毛孔，讓身體在短時間內大量出汗，不僅有助於「袪濕、化痰」，還能將累積在皮下的酸性廢物排出，使肌膚更加健康有彈性。
	* [Sauna](sauna.md)
* _Decrease_ Core Body Temperature (CBT)
* ~57 mins per week
* Timing
	* Later in the evening

# Cold Exposure

* ≈ Cryotherapy ≈ Cold-Water Immersion [^1]
* Formats
	* Cold shower
	* Ice bath
		* Pro Tip: The less water you use, the less ice you need to lower the temperature.
	* Cold plunge = Cold water immersion
		* Always dunk. Dip your face. Full send finish is mandatory! [^2]
* _Increase_ Core Body Temperature (CBT)
* ~11 mins per week
	* 2-4 sessions lasting 1-5 mins each distributed across the week
	* 2-3 minutes cold showers * 5 per week
	* Or: _Challenge yourself by [counting walls](https://youtu.be/pq6WHJzOkno?t=2308) and setting a goal of “walls” to traverse (e.g., 3-5 walls) during the round of cold exposure._
* Timing
	* Early in the morning

# Vocalizing, Including Moaning During Cold Exposure

* **Stress Release**: Helps relieve emotional discomfort caused by the cold.
* **Breathing Regulation**: Encourages calm, rhythmic breathing, preventing the body from going into shock or hyperventilation.
* **Distraction**: Redirects focus away from the intense cold sensations.
* **Warmth Generation**: If moaning is paired with physical vibrations or movements (like _shivering_ or _humming_), it might help slightly by generating heat or maintaining circulation.
* **Mental Resilience**: Promotes a sense of control.

Cooling “Glabrous Skin Surfaces” [^3] can…

* significantly improve physical performance and enhance endurance.
* reduce core body temperature more efficiently (as these areas contain specialized vascular structures that facilitate _heat loss_), and even assist in emergency situations like **Heat Stroke (Hyperthermia)** by cooling the body more rapidly than traditional methods.

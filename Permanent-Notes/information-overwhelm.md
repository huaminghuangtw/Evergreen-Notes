> _“Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?” ― T.S. Eliot, [The Waste Land and Other Poems](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/15306654)_ [^1]

> _Knowledge is cumulative. Intelligence is selective. It’s a matter of efficiency versus effectiveness._

# Problems

* 資訊爆炸/洪流的時代
	* In the age of
		* Information abundance/overload
		* Infinite information on the internet
	* We all live in a consumption-oriented life. Fast consumption, constant consumption, more consumption.
* [“The Never-Ending Now” by David Perell](https://perell.com/essay/never-ending-now/)
* 數位焦慮 FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out)
* Most of us only consume contents created
	* within the last 24 hours (e.g., news)
	* recommended by the “For You” algorithm (e.g., YT videos, SM feeds)
* [Functional Illiteracy](Functional%20Illiteracy.md)

# Solutions

* Just-In-Case information → Just-In-Time information
	* It’s not enough to use information for “something” — it needs to be immediate and important. If “no” on either count, don’t consume it. [Information is useless if it is not applied to something important](cultivate-a-strong-bias-towards-action.md) or if you will forget it before you have a chance to apply it.
* Reactive → Proactive
	* Develop the habit of asking yourself, “_Will I definitely use this information for something immediate and important?_” before consuming any content
* Fast, excessive consumption → Slow, gradual engagement
* FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) → JOMO (Joy Of Missing Out)
	* “Try to get to the _bottom_ of things, not stay on _top_ of things.”
	* 不要害怕錯過資訊，因為如果是真的很重要的資訊，它會再次出現在我們眼前
		* 就跟手機來電一樣，如果真的很重要，對方會再打一次，如果沒有再次來電，代表是不重要的事情
	* Practice strategic ignorance—sometimes, choosing what to pay attention to and letting go of the rest is true bliss.

	* [News Sobriety](News%20Sobriety.md)
* The Laundry Cycle Mentality
	* Think about the areas of your life where you are placing unnecessary pressure on yourself to have everything in a “completed” state, e.g., to-read pile (Read-It-Later → Never-Read-It).
	* Perhaps that area is better viewed as a RIVER than as a BUCKET — as a cycle, not a fixed state.
* Build a [note-taking habit](note-taking.md) and an [idea-capturing system](idea-capture-inbox.md)
* Consume less. [Reflect/Review](reflect-and-review.md) or [Create/Produce/Make/Build](creativity-is-just-connecting-things.md) More.
	* Embrace [Low Information Diet](Low%20Information%20Diet.md) to avoid the “[Mental Squeeze Point](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/Mental+Squeeze+Point)”
	* Spend more time _connecting dots (convergent exploiting)_ than you do _collecting them (divergent exploring)_
	* Strive for a balance between _consuming_ and _digesting_ information—because if you only take in content without truly processing it, you’re likely to forget most of what you encounter.
	* If you decide to consume something:
		* Consume what you are going to create

			* Mindset Shift: Consumer → Producer
			* 帶著「輸出」的前提去「輸入」（[Writing Worth Reading](https://fs.blog/reading)）：「當我吸收這些資訊&知識後，我要寫出一篇可以公開發表的筆記（或部落格文章）」
		* Only consume quality contents that have stood the test of time.

			* [Brain Attic](Brain%20Attic.md)
		* Read fewer forecasts and more history. Study history to predict the future.

			> _“Learn enough from history to respect one another’s delusions.” — Will Durant_

			> _“Reality will pay you back in equal proportion to your delusion.” — Will Smith_

			* It’s all just history repeating itself (Historic Recurrence).
			* Humans tend to repeat the mistakes humans make.
	* Remember: _Information_ and _knowledge_ are two different things!

		* 「批判 \& 獨立思考」的能力至關重要

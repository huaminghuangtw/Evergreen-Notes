Failure to prepare means preparing to fail.

Planning and [doing](cultivate-a-strong-bias-towards-action.md) are two different modes of operation. **Separate planning from doing.** [^1] Spend some time on _[task value/priority evaluation/assessment](Prioritization.md)_ before any commitments/effort. It’s worth it. [^2]

❗️Be aware of [the difference between “being in motion” and “taking action”](https://jamesclear.com/taking-action) [^3]

❗Too much → [Procrastination](procrastination.md)

* Planning is based on the expectation of order. Preparation is based on the expectation of chaos.
* Plan for order and you’ll be destroyed by chaos. Prepare for chaos and you’ll thrive in any condition.

No matter how often I tried to just jump right in a new task, I found that I performed my best when I invested a little bit of time in formulating a plan—By defining some CLARITY before starting something saves me a huge amount of time later on.

**Mise en place** is a French culinary phrase which means “putting in place” or “gather”. It refers to the setup required before cooking, and is often used in professional kitchens to refer to organizing and arranging the ingredients (e.g., cuts of meat, relishes, sauces, par-cooked items, spices, freshly chopped vegetables, and other components) that a cook will require for the menu items.

When fishermen can’t go to sea, they repair their nets. When the sea is too rough to sail, the wise don’t simply wait for the storm to pass—they prepare for the moment it does. Even in stillness, there is progress. It’s not about idling; it’s about using the pause to build [what comes next](just-focus-on-the-next-decision.md).

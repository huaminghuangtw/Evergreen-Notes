> “A walk in nature walks the soul back home.” — Mary Davis

> “Above all, do not lose your desire to walk. Everyday, I walk myself into a state of well-being & walk away from every illness. I have walked myself into my best thoughts, and I know of no thought so burdensome that one cannot walk away from it.” — Søren Kierkegaard

> “I can only meditate when I am walking. When I stop, I cease to think; my mind works only with my legs.” — Jean-Jacques Rousseau
>
> 散步促進我的思想。唯有身體不停行走，腦筋才會甦醒運轉。

**[Solvitur Ambulando: It Is Solved By Walking](https://sketchplanations.com/solvitur-ambulando)**

**Forward Ambulation** is another word to move forward - like taking a walk, biking or running!

**Incidental Exercise** is the physical activity required to engage in normal daily activities over the course of our day.

You’ll never regret taking a walk outside.

* Motion is lotion.
* Move to move the mind.

Goal: 8000–10000 steps per day

* 10 minutes of walking is around 1,000 steps

康德（Immanuel Kant）每天在固定時間散步，準時到鄰居可以用他出門的時刻校對時鐘。他一生幾乎沒有離開過故鄉柯尼斯堡（Königsberg），生活環境單純而規律。堪稱自律的典範。

# Benefits

* generates [optic flow](optic-flow.md)
* lowers activity in the [amygdala](amygdala.md), thereby reducing levels of [stress and anxiety](stress-and-anxiety.md)
* leads to focused alertness
* opens up the free flow of creative ideas — a thought process called [Divergent Thinking](lateral-thinking.md)

# How To Get More Daily Walking Steps In?

* Walk for transportation
	* If you take a bus or train as part of your commute, getting off a stop or two earlier
* Try parking further
* Use stairs instead of elevators
* Take a 5-10 min post-meal walk
* Get a walking pad for a treadmill-desk setup

# Tips

* Walk alone or with someone else ([pair walking](https://www.google.com/search?q=pair+walking)). You can enjoy health benefits, plus enjoy your surroundings or enjoy a good conversation.
* Frequent, multiple, and brief walking breaks throughout the day are more effective at improving well-being than a single, longish walk — especially if you’re busy or get fatigued easily.
	* Devote _five minutes every hour_ to physical activity, whether you walk up and down a staircase, along a corridor or just pace around your office. [@bergouignanEffectFrequentInterruptions2016]
* Walk in nature (Park Walk) > Walk in urban (Street Walk) [@sellersTakeWalkPark2012] [@bratmanNatureExperienceReduces2015]
	* Walking in nature significantly reduced rumination (the act of dwelling on negative thoughts, replaying mistakes, or worrying about the future) and activity in the corresponding part of the brain, while those assigned to urban walks experienced no notable impact, highlighting the enhanced mental health benefits of natural environments.
* **Break Walks**
* **Active Walks:** I will often spend my active walks listening to an audiobook or podcast, or thinking about something specific that I want to work through (a problem, writing idea, etc.).
* **Passive “Tech-Free” Walks**
	* Passive walks are “atelic” [^1] activities (meaning they are done with no goal in mind). These walks are 30-60 minutes and are done at a slow, leisurely pace with no technology. Leave your phone at home. [Let your mind wander. Allow your ideas to mingle. I’d suggest bringing a little pocket notebook to log anything interesting that comes into your head (it will happen!).](creativity-is-just-connecting-things.md)
	* Raw dog your walks. When you go out for a walk, leave your phone behind—no calls, no music, no podcasts. Just you and your thoughts. It’s one of the best things you can do for your brain and mind, and I promise you’ll feel the difference.
	* Go on a walk without phone.
* Nordic Walking
* Walking Meditation
* Rucking: walking with weight on your back

# 走路姿勢

1. **深吸氣 → 挺胸 → 收小腹**：啟動核心，避免塌腰或聳肩。
2. **手肘快速擺動**：擺臂能提高心率、增加全身能量消耗。
3. **最大步幅前進**：
	* 「最大步幅」指的是在不失去穩定性的前提下你能跨出的最大步伐。
	* 步幅變大會自然帶動臀大肌、腿後肌（腿後腱）更強力啟動，有助提升下半身線條。

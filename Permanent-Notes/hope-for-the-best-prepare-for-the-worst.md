# The Stockdale Paradox

* The ability to hold two minds at once:
	1. An unwavering faith in your ability to prevail
	2. A clear-eyed recognition of the harsh reality of the present
* 一方面對於前途保持堅定的信心，另一方面以務實和實際的態度認清殘酷的現實
* 相信自己能夠在未來實現某個目標，同時抱持謙虛的態度，質疑自己現在的方法是否得當

# A Zen Story: The Cut Crystal Glass

> A Zen master received a beautiful glass cup from a former student. He loved it, used it daily, and showed it to visitors. he would hold the cup in his hand and remind himself, “This cup is already broken.”
>
> One day, a visitor knocked the cup from its shelf. It fell to the ground and broke into pieces. While others gasped, the master stayed calm. Smiling, he said, “Ah, yes, let’s begin,” picked up a broom, and started to sweep up the pieces.

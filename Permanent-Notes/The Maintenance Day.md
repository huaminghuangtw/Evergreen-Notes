> _[“I have a Sunday ritual called “maintenance day”. On maintenance day, I lump all of the boring tasks that most people do throughout the week into one solid block of time on one day. Every Sunday, for straight five or six hours, I do every undesirable task that people typically do during the week. I do the laundry, clean, go grocery shopping, create a meal and workout plan for the week, cut my nails, water my plants, and everything else maintainence-y under the sun.”](https://chrisbailey.com/maintenance-day/) — [Chris Bailey](https://chrisbailey.com/)_

Group all of your “boring maintenance tasks” together (aka **batching**) and do them on this day.

> _“The longer I live, the more deeply I learn that love — whether we call it friendship or family or romance — is the work of mirroring and magnifying each other’s light.” — James Baldwin_

> _“You don’t earn loyalty in a day. You earn loyalty day-by-day.” — Jeffrey Gitomer_

> _“Relationships are mysterious. We doubt the positive qualities in others, seldom the negative. You will say to your partner: do you really love me? Are you sure you love me? You will ask this a dozen times and drive the person nuts. But you never ask: are you really mad at me? Are you sure you’re angry? When someone is angry, you don’t doubt it for a moment. Yet the reverse should be true. We should doubt the negative in life, and have faith in the positive.” — Christopher Pike, Remember Me_

> _[“We have to recognize that there cannot be relationships unless there is commitment, unless there is loyalty, unless there is love, patience, persistence.” — Cornel West, Breaking Bread: Insurgent Black Intellectual Life](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/234703-we-have-to-recognise-that-there-cannot-be-relationships-unless)_

> _“The best relationships are a balance of connection and freedom.” — Esther Perel_

# 把所有關係都回歸到友情

愛情，是友情加上一點心動；親情，是友情加上一點血緣。

當 [友情](a-friend-to-all-is-a-friend-to-none.md) 成為關係的核心，你會發現那些規則和壓力都自然消失。友情是最自然、自由、自在的連結，它建立在互相欣賞、認同與信任上，不需要任何外在約束，反而更穩固。

擁有這樣的心態，你就能純粹地認識一個人，而不被世俗眼光中「應該如此」的標籤限制住 — 比如「一定要結婚」或「在家裡必須扮演某種角色」。只有放下這些不必要的框架，你才能開始真正欣賞一個人的獨特之處。

# Two Pillars of Relationships

1. Outreach involves meeting new people and reconnecting with those you may not see regularly.
2. Connection focuses on nurturing deeper, more meaningful bonds with those already in your life.

## When someone has a problem, ask if they want empathy or a solution

We often jump into “Mr. Fix It” mode, eager to [offer advice](advice.md) and [solve a problem](Problem%20Solving.md). However, this can create tension because people don’t always want a solution; sometimes, they just want to feel heard and understood. In fact, **most arguments are not really about the argument, so most arguments can’t be won by arguing.**

The next time a friend, partner, or family member comes to you with a problem, resist the urge to immediately offer advice. Instead, take a moment and ask a simple question to clarify what they truly need. You can frame it as:

* _“Do you want to be helped, heard, or hugged?”_
	* The 3H (Helped, Heard, or Hugged) Method
* _“Do you want empathy or do you want a solution?”_

	> Source: [Lisa Feldman Barrett: Balancing the Brain Budget \[The Knowledge Project Ep. #92\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jORaNMIGiok&t=48m1s)

This simple step can prevent misunderstandings and show that you’re there for them in the way they need you to be. People want to feel understood, and sometimes the best support you can offer is just your presence and a listening ear.

When we find ourselves in an argument or debate with someone, we often become more focused on ‘winning’ the argument rather than actually discovering the truth.

# Iron Man vs. Straw Man: Why You Should Build Strong Arguments for Ideas You Disagree With

How to overcome **the straw man argument**? use **the steel/iron man argument**: Instead of going on the attack, we help our opponent to build the _strongest possible version_ of their argument, and then engage with _that_.

1. **Paraphrase their point (and check to see that the agree)** - _So, if I understand you correctly, you’re saying X. Is that right?_
2. **Strengthen their point (and ask if they agree)** - _Interesting. You could even take it a bit further and say X._
3. **Only then, engage with the argument** - _That’s a compelling perspective. But, I find myself disagreeing with X. What do you think?_

The best way to argue is to engage with your opponent’s strongest points, not their weakest.

* Express your opponent’s position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that they respond, “Yes, that’s exactly what I meant — I wish I’d said it that way.”
* Aim to articulate their position with such clarity and fairness that they acknowledge, “You’ve captured my view better than I could myself.”

* [Three Types of “Bad” Arguments](https://fs.blog/bad-arguments/)

A good exercise: write an essay that argued BOTH sides of a point we felt strongly about.

1. Your side
2. The dissenting side

Remember: The ultimate goal is to [find the truth](Seek%20for%20the%20truth.md), not to win. An argument is when you are trying to decide WHO is right, a discussion is when you are trying to decide WHAT is right.

Relationships are, by definition, a series of repeated interactions. In those scenarios, the best strategy is called [tit-for-tat with forgiveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat). If you only play once, the best strategy is to be selfish, according to game theory.

---

Never leave a conversation without asking “how can I help you?” Everyone subconsciously values reciprocity and aid.

Share with someone who wants to listen or listen to someone who wants to share.

# The Principles of Connected Conversation

* Principle 1: Create Doorknobs (that lead to a story rather than end the conversation)
* Principle 2: Be a Loud Listener
	* <u>Sounds</u>: Saying “yes” or “uh-huh” or “hmm” to signal listening and encourage continued energy from the speaker.
	* <u>Facial Expressions</u>: Changing facial expressions to react physically to the story being told.
	* <u>Body Language</u>: Forward lean posture towards the speaker signals engagement and positive energy. Never turn away or sideways, as it signals you are trying to leave a conversation and immediately hurts the energy of a moment.
* Principle 3: Repeat \& Follow
	* Repeating key points back to the speaker in your own words and following on with an additional insight, story, or doorknob.
* Principle 4: Make Situational Eye Contact
	* Deep and connected while they speak.
	* Organic while you speak - It’s ok to gaze off while you think, but use eye contact to emphasize key points and moments in a story.

# The Vampire Test

* If, after hanging out with someone making you feel worn out and depleted, that person is a vampire (能量吸血鬼).
	* There are two red flags to avoid almost all dangerous people:
		* The perpetually aggrieved
		* The angry
* If, after hanging out with someone making you feel full of energy, that person is not a vampire.

The ideal dynamic relationship involves two people who are independently strong but come together to create a deeply connected, emotionally safe, and attached bond. This is in contrast to a toxic relationship where individuals focus solely on making themselves happy and then expecting to be happy together.

While you can’t control an interrupter, what you can do is turn it into a learning experience - Rather than being offended, any time someone interrupts you, see it as a positive opportunity. Stop and hone in, understanding that this is an important issue for them.

# Mel Robbins’ Text Message Challenge

If you want to improve any relationship in your life, pull out your phone and send this message to that person: **“What can I do to be a better X to you?”** (partner, friend, son, etc.)

You don’t know a person until:

1. You travel with them.
2. Money is involved.
3. You deal with them when they’re angry.
4. You live with them.

> _“The longer I live, the more deeply I learn that love — whether we call it friendship or family or romance — is the work of mirroring and magnifying each other’s light.” — James Baldwin_

> _“You don’t earn loyalty in a day. You earn loyalty day-by-day.” — Jeffrey Gitomer_

> _“Relationships are mysterious. We doubt the positive qualities in others, seldom the negative. You will say to your partner: do you really love me? Are you sure you love me? You will ask this a dozen times and drive the person nuts. But you never ask: are you really mad at me? Are you sure you’re angry? When someone is angry, you don’t doubt it for a moment. Yet the reverse should be true. We should doubt the negative in life, and have faith in the positive.” — Christopher Pike, Remember Me_

> _["We have to recognize that there cannot be relationships unless there is commitment, unless there is loyalty, unless there is love, patience, persistence." — Cornel West, Breaking Bread: Insurgent Black Intellectual Life](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/234703-we-have-to-recognise-that-there-cannot-be-relationships-unless)_

心若親近，言行必如流水般自然；心若疏遠，言行就如三秋之樹般蕭瑟。不怕身隔天涯，只怕心在南北。

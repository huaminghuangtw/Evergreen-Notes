> _“The longer I live, the more deeply I learn that love — whether we call it friendship or family or romance — is the work of mirroring and magnifying each other’s light.” — James Baldwin_

> _“You don’t earn loyalty in a day. You earn loyalty day-by-day.” — Jeffrey Gitomer_

> _“Relationships are mysterious. We doubt the positive qualities in others, seldom the negative. You will say to your partner: do you really love me? Are you sure you love me? You will ask this a dozen times and drive the person nuts. But you never ask: are you really mad at me? Are you sure you’re angry? When someone is angry, you don’t doubt it for a moment. Yet the reverse should be true. We should doubt the negative in life, and have faith in the positive.” — Christopher Pike, Remember Me_

> _[“We have to recognize that there cannot be relationships unless there is commitment, unless there is loyalty, unless there is love, patience, persistence.” — Cornel West, Breaking Bread: Insurgent Black Intellectual Life](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/234703-we-have-to-recognise-that-there-cannot-be-relationships-unless)_

> _“The best relationships are a balance of connection and freedom.” — Esther Perel_

> _“Understand that friends come and go, but with a precious few you should hold on. Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle, because the older you get, the more you need the people who knew you when you were young.” — Mary Schmich_

[The 4 horsemen of relationship apocalypse](https://sketchplanations.com/the-4-horsemen-of-relationship-apocalypse)

1. **Criticism**: framing problems as the partner’s defect
2. **Defensiveness**: counterattacking, whining, being the innocent victim
3. **Contempt**: talking down from a position of superiority, insults, eye-rolling, name-calling — the most dangerous of all
4. **Stonewalling**: withdrawing from the conflict, refusing to engage

---

心若親近，言行必如流水般自然；心若疏遠，言行就如三秋之樹般蕭瑟。不怕身隔天涯，只怕心在南北。

---

喜歡一個人是例外，不喜歡一個人才是常態。

---

你我之間剛剛好的距離是：

1. 遠不孤單，近不受傷
2. 不會因過於親近而受傷，也不會因過於疏遠而感到孤單

# 把所有關係都回歸到友情

愛情，是友情加上一點心動；親情，是友情加上一點血緣。

當 [友情](a-friend-to-all-is-a-friend-to-none.md) 成為關係的核心，你會發現那些規則和壓力都自然消失。友情是最自然、自由、自在的連結，它建立在互相欣賞、認同與信任上，不需要任何外在約束，反而更穩固。

擁有這樣的心態，你就能純粹地認識一個人，而不被世俗眼光中「應該如此」的標籤限制住 — 比如「一定要結婚」或「在家裡必須扮演某種角色」。只有放下這些不必要的框架，你才能開始真正欣賞一個人的獨特之處。

# Two Pillars of Relationships

1. Outreach involves meeting new people and reconnecting with those you may not see regularly.
2. Connection focuses on nurturing deeper, more meaningful bonds with those already in your life.

It’s usually better to be nice than right.

# [Dr. Robert Waldinger](https://www.robertwaldinger.com/) [^1]

* [Relationship satisfaction at age 50 was the single greatest predictor of physical health at age 80.](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/over-nearly-80-years-harvard-study-has-been-showing-how-to-live-a-healthy-and-happy-life/)
* Ambivalent relationships—those that are sometimes supportive and sometimes demeaning—are the most toxic.

---

位置不同，少言為貴；認知不同，不爭不辯；三觀不合，浪費口舌！

---

Every relationship in your life can be placed within a 2 × 2 matrix based upon:

1. How healthy it is
2. How enjoyable it is

---

When we find ourselves in an argument or debate with someone, we often become more focused on ‘winning’ the argument rather than actually discovering the truth. When arguing, the goal is come to a consensus, not to “win.”

---

Remember: [Life is not a debate—it’s not about winning the argument or being right.](https://tim.blog/2018/08/02/ann-miura-ko/) Winning an argument doesn’t make you right. Someone might win an argument and still be wrong. Being good at debating is not the same as being right.

# [The Go-First Principle](The%20Go-First%20Principle.md)

---

Relationships are, by definition, a series of repeated interactions. In those scenarios, the best strategy is called [tit-for-tat with forgiveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat). If you only play once, the best strategy is to be selfish, according to game theory.

---

Never leave a conversation without asking “How can I help you?” Everyone subconsciously values reciprocity and aid.

---

Share with someone who wants to listen or listen to someone who wants to share.

# Shared Struggle

> _“Trouble shared is trouble halved.” — Lee Iacocca_

* builds unbreakable bonds that transcend time and distance.
* releases oxytocin, a chemical that creates feelings of love and connection.

True connection often come from overcoming challenges together.

True bonds are often forged through adversity.

> _“Shared joy is a double joy; shared sorrow is half sorrow.” — Swedish Proverb_

* When one person shares good news with another, both people are happy.
* When one person shares sad news with another, the act of sharing takes some of the sadness away.

# The Vampire Test

* If, after hanging out with someone making you feel worn out and depleted, that person is a vampire (能量吸血鬼).
	* There are two red flags to avoid almost all dangerous people:
		* The perpetually aggrieved
		* The angry
* If, after hanging out with someone making you feel full of energy, that person is not a vampire.

---

The ideal dynamic relationship involves two people who are independently strong but come together to create a deeply connected, emotionally safe, and attached bond. This is in contrast to a toxic relationship where individuals focus solely on making themselves happy and then expecting to be happy together.

---

While you can’t control an interrupter, what you can do is turn it into a learning experience - Rather than being offended, any time someone interrupts you, see it as a positive opportunity. Stop and hone in, understanding that this is an important issue for them.

# Mel Robbins’ Text Message Challenge

If you want to improve any relationship in your life, pull out your phone and send this message to that person: **“What can I do to be a better X to you?”** (partner, friend, son, etc.)

---

You don’t know a person until:

1. You travel with them.
2. Money is involved.
3. You deal with them when they’re angry.
4. You live with them.

# Two “Selves” within Each of Us

[@gallweyInnerGameTennis2015]

* <u>Self 1</u>: the explicit, thinking part that tries to catch the ball.
* <u>Self 2</u>: the implicit, non-thinking part that actually catches the ball.

The more Self 1 cares about achieving a goal, the more it interferes with the natural functioning of Self 2. _This is why, counterintuitively, the less you care about something, the more easily, effortlessly and effectively it can be achieved._

# The difference between “not caring” and “not intending”

* Caring is as described above, and comes with a sense of the outcome being important, that it (or we) would bad if the outcome weren’t achieved. There is a physical tension associated with it.
* Intending is the [activation energy](why-is-it-so-hard-to-just-do-the-work.md) required to take a specific action. I can intend to catch the ball (or not) as it flies towards me, while not caring whether or not I actually catch it.

In this frame, the ideal combination to minimize or remove self-interference is to have a strong and unambiguous intention while caring as little as possible. The worst combination for our performance is to have a weak and ambiguous intention while caring strongly about achieving a particular outcome.

# “Be sincere, not serious” by Alan Watts

> _“I am always sincere, but never serious.” — Alan Watts_

## Group 1

* Suppose you are a student. Your parents want you to have good grade in exams. You also want to be a class topper. Hence, you do your studies with high devotion. Sometimes you become bored and start to play video games. After an hour, you feel that you have a lot of homework to be done. So, again you pick up your books. Whenever you start spending some hours other than studying, you feel you are wasting your time. You also feel you have to utilize every second you have to achieve your goal. You are **serious.**
* Your best friend has the same goal as you have. He also wants to top the class. But he cannot devote every second in studies like you. Whenever he likes to play video games, he plays for hours. But after that, when his heart tells him to study, he does it with full concentration. Everything he does is in a heartfelt manner. He is very genuine with his inner feelings. He is **sincere.**

## Group 2

* If you were approaching a difficult project at work sincerely rather than seriously, you might focus on the process of completing each task, rather than becoming fixated on the end result. You might also seek out the input and collaboration of others, rather than trying to tackle the project on your own. By doing these things, you may find that it’s easier to approach it in the spirit of play, and that you’re better able to stay focused and motivated throughout.
* If you were approaching a job interview sincerely rather than seriously, then instead of becoming overly nervous and stressed about the outcome, you might focus on being present and engaged. You might also try to connect with the interviewer on a more personal level, rather than simply trying to impress them with your credentials. By doing so, you might be more likely to approach the interview with lightness and ease, and to come away from the interview feeling more confident and satisfied with your performance.
* If you were approaching writing a book sincerely rather than seriously, you might decide to throw a detailed homage to World of Warcraft into the very first chapter - illustrating to your future readers that even when creating something as significant as your first book, you can treat the process with levity. By doing so, you’d hopefully help the text create a sense of fun, even while holding forth on the science of productivity.

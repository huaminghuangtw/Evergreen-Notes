The question is: what do we do between the time we're born and the time he shows up. Because when he shows up, it's too late to do all the things that you're always gonna, kinda get around to. **It is not the things we do in life that we regret on our death bed. It is the things we do not.**” — Randy Pausch](https://youtu.be/RcYv5x6gZTA)_

[There are two ways to live a longer life:](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/february-27-2025)

1. Biologically. Extend the timeline between your birth and your death.
2. Psychologically. Fit more lives into whatever time you are given.

Many people just fill their hours with things that are easy rather than things that are hard, and things that are forgettable rather than things that are memorable.

Don't be a “Living Dead.” Don't _die_ before you are _dead_.

* 「大半的人在二十歲或三十歲上就死了。一過這個年齡，他們只變了自己的影子。以後的生命不過是用來模仿自己，把以前真正有人味的時代所說的，所做的，所想的，所喜歡的，一天天的重複，而且重複的方式越來越機械，越來越脫腔走板。」— Christopher Nolan
* _“Most people die at 25 and aren't buried until they're 75.” — Benjamin Franklin_
* _“To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.” — Oscar Wilde_
* _“Some people are old at 19 and some are still young at 90.”_
* 乾枯的靈魂

Run your mind in a debug mode instead of autopilot mode 24/7

> _“So few people are really aware of their thoughts. Their minds run all over the place without their permission, and they go along for the ride unknowingly and without making a choice. […] If you are not in control of your thoughts then you are not in control of yourself. Without self-control, you have no real power, regardless of whatever else you accomplish. If you are not aware of the thoughts that you are thinking in each moment, then you are the rider with no reins, with no power over where you are going. You cannot control what you are not aware of. Awareness must come first.” ― Thomas M. Sterner, [The Practicing Mind: Bringing Discipline and Focus into Your Life](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/326331)_

* _“Watch every thought (, word, and act). Always ask, why am I having this thought (, word, and act)?” — Naval Ravikant_
* 不要讓生活、工作、時間被「**預設值** 」決定
* 很多時候我們的說話、決定、行動都沒有經過足夠的「思辨」、「深思熟慮」和「自覺」，而在不知不覺中採取了某種「習以為常」的僵化模式

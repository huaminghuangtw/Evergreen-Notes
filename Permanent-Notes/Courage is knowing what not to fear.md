Intelligence isn’t just about what you know. It is also the ability to avoid being your own bottleneck.

* If you lack the skills, be willing to look foolish while you learn them.
* If you lack the connections, be courageous enough to reach out and build them.
* If you feel uncertain, be bold enough to figure it out along the way.

Many people have the ability, but they talk themselves out of trying.

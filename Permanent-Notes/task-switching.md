≈ Context Switching

---

When we attempt to juggle multiple tasks simultaneously, the brain has to shift focus from one task to another. This switching isn’t instantaneous; it requires cognitive resources to re-orient and re-engage with the new task. Therefore, when transitioning from one task to another, it’s important to have a brief **transition period**.

* During this period, the focus is on _**reflecting**_ on the previous task and mentally _**disengaging**_ from it, rather than immediately trying to focus on the next task.
* By doing so, we avoid placing unfair expectations on our neural circuits to instantly switch to task B, and reduce the time it takes to fully engage in task B.
* Do not introduce a new task, e.g., checking the phone, in between task A and task B. (This is not a time to look at your phone!)

Sometimes the greatest act of kindness is…

* to pretend you haven’t already heard that story before.
* to not tell people that they have a sunburn, bug bite, or zit.

# Horizontal Relationships

Treat everyone as equal, regardless of status or age. Avoid hierarchical thinking.

You are how you treat people when nobody’s watching. [Character is who you are when nobody’s watching.](character-is-who-you-are-when-nobodys-watching.md)

You can tell a lot about someone’s character by how they treat service staff.

> 觀察一個人對待服務生/侍者的態度，就可以大致看出一個人的真實性格。若是採取冷漠和輕視的態度，或是命令的口氣，就可以知道這個人不適合長期來往，因為有很大的機率，他們內心有一種優越感，認為自己比別人高級，缺乏站在他人角度思考的同理心。

Treating people with deference — whether they’re above you (superior), beside you (peer), or below you (subordinate) — invites appreciation and earns lasting respect.

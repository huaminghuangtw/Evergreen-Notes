#TODO

* Order:
	* 淋浴間 Shower (to rinse off any dirt, sweat, or lotions on your skin)
	* 蒸氣室 Steam room (to open up pores, promote blood circulation, and relax muscles)
	* 烤箱 Sauna
* 🛀 Heat-Cold Contrast Therapy (**The Kneipp Therapy**)
	* Sauna Session 15-20 mins + Ice Baths/Cold Shower/Cold Plunge 5 mins) ONCE a week
		* 加入浴鹽 (Epsom Salt) [^1] + 茶樹精油 (Tea Tree Oil) [^2]
		* Prefer traditional sauna instead of infrared sauna, due to the heat range they can reach
			* According to Andrew Huberman, the optimal temperature for sauna therapy is 80-87 degree Celsius
	* Do 2-3 rounds of 冷熱交替的三溫暖 (hot → quick cold shower \& warm foot bath → cooldown)
		* Hot: 5-20 mins
		* Take a quick cold shower \& warm foot bath (+ drink a glass of water) between sauna sessions
		* Cooldown: 10-15 mins (in fresh air, sit still)
* Before the sauna
	* Shower and DRY OFF COMPLETELY, because dry skin sweats/perspires faster than moist
	* Eat LIGHT snack
* In the sauna
	* Always underlay your towel on the wood before you sit or lay down, so that your body does not come into contact with the wood. Also, make sure your feet go on your towel.
		* Exception: “Dampfbad” or steam room. These rooms have stone seats that you rinse off with water — no towels allowed.
		* Lying on the bench helps evenly distribute the heat along your body
		* The higher up you sit in the sauna, the higher the temperature.
			* It is most effective to sweat briefly but violently on the upper benches.
	* Unwind: meditation, breathwork, tree pose, sit stretching, etc.
	* Remove jewelry or watches to avoid damaging them in the heat and moisture
* After the sauna
	* Shower and let your body cool completely before getting dressed (or you’re gonna sweat)
	* Drink LOTS of water (Stay hydrated)
	* Eat after one hour
* Why no clothes? (only “towel” or “robe”)
	* A swimsuit get in the way of your body/skin properly sweating out impurities. Textiles can bring in bacteria that will grow in hot sauna.
* Russian Banya (wet-steam) v.s Traditional Steam (dry-steam)
	* Parenie Treatment
* 德文單字
	* Dampfbad = Rasulbad
	* Aufguss
	* Kaminzimmer (壁爐室)

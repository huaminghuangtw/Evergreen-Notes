> “Do one thing every day that scares you.” — Eleanor Roosevelt

> “Do what you dream of doing even while you’re afraid.” — Arianna Huffington

> “If it’s your job to eat a frog, it’s best to do it first thing in the morning. And if it’s your job to eat two frogs, it’s best to eat the biggest one first.”

> “The key is not to [prioritize](Prioritization.md) what’s on your schedule, but to schedule your priorities.” — Stephen Covey

> _[“If you don’t prioritize, everything seems urgent and important. If you define the single most important task for each day, almost nothing seems urgent or important. Oftentimes, it’s just a matter of letting (fires burn/) small little bad things happen (e.g., return a phone call late and apologize, pay a small late fee, lose an unreasonable customer, etc.) to get the big important things done. The answer to overwhelm is not spinning more plates—or doing more—it’s defining the few things that can really fundamentally change your business and life.” — Tim Ferriss](https://x.com/tferriss/status/1674772152589996034)_ [^1]

# Always Important, Never Urgent

First things first. Do the most important thing [^2] first, not the most urgent one.

> There is never enough time to do everything, but there is always enough time to do the most important thing.

[早上是一天當中最有精力、思路最清晰、心智能量最彙集/最強大的時刻](work-in-sprints-work-with-your-biology.md)，要用來做：

* Things that genuinely matter to you.
* Things that require lots of [brain power](do-not-use-your-willpower-unless-you-absolutely-have-to.md) (e.g., writing, coding).
* Things that you are easily tempted to do something else.
* Things that you are not enjoying that much.
* Things that you feel most uncomfortable with and scare you most, usually due to some chances of rejection or conflict.

# [Tim Ferriss’ Framework](https://tim.blog/2013/11/03/productivity-hacks/)

1. Wake up at least 1 hour before you have to be at a computer screen. E-mail is the mind killer.
2. Make a cup of tea (I like pu-erh) and sit down with a pen/pencil and paper.
3. Write down the 3 things — and no more — that are making you most anxious or uncomfortable. They’re often things that have been punted from one day’s to-do list to the next, to the next, to the next, and so on. **Most important usually = most uncomfortable**, with some chance of rejection or conflict.
4. For each item, ask yourself:
	* “_If this were the only thing I accomplished today, would I be satisfied with my day?_”
	* “_Will moving this forward make all the other TODOs unimportant/irrelevant or easier to do later?_”
5. Look only at the items you’ve answered “yes” to for at least one of these questions.
6. Block out at least 2–3 hours to focus on ONE of them for today. Let the rest of the urgent but less important stuff slide. It will still be there tomorrow.
	* TO BE CLEAR: Block out at least 2–3 HOURS to focus on ONE of them for today. This is ONE BLOCK OF TIME. Cobbling together 10 minutes here and there to add up to 120 minutes does not work.
7. If you get [distracted](being-indistractable-is-superpower.md) or start [procrastinating](procrastination.md), [don’t freak out and downward spiral; just gently come back to your ONE to-do.](self-compassion.md)

* **Sacred Morning Free Time**, where you can take advantage of the tranquility of the quiet morning
* **Quite/Dark Hours**
* **The Golden/Holy/Power Hour**
	* Spending an hour in the morning before checking any emails, notifications, or text messages, and exclusively working on the “Important but not Urgent” stuff.
* **Magic Time**
	* This is a _[long/solid/consecutive/uninterrupted/unbroken blocks/slabs of time](deep-work.md)_, where you are three times more productive than usual.
	* _“An hour before 9 is worth two after 5.”_ — It feels like gaining extra hours in your day!

You need to find XXX in your day, and ruthlessly foster/protect it from all the time thieves in your life. When you [combine XXX with a deadline](the-parkinsons-law.md), you QUADRUPLE your productivity.

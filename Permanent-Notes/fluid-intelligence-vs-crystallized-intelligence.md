* The theory of Fluid vs. Crystallized Intelligence was developed by psychologist Raymond Cattell in the 1970s. [@brooksStrengthStrengthFinding2022]
* 年輕時依賴流體智力，隨著年齡增長逐漸發揮晶體智力。

# 「流體智力」(Fluid Intelligence, G<sub>f</sub>)

* 流體智力指邏輯推理、靈活思考以及解決新問題的能力，通常在成年早期達到高峰，30 至 40 歲後開始下滑。
* It is characterized by the ability to think creatively and abstractly, learn new concepts, draw flexible connections, and reason across different domains.
* Fluid Intelligence represents the intelligence of _youth_. It peaks during the early stages of one’s career—generally in the 20s and 30s—and begins to decline thereafter. Many groundbreaking innovations stem from Fluid Intelligence, which explains why a significant proportion of such achievements come from individuals in the early stages of their careers.

# 「晶體智力」(Crystallized Intelligence, G<sub>c</sub>)

* 晶體智力指運用累積知識、經驗、技能與洞見的能力。隨著年齡增長，晶體智力在 40 至 60 歲期間持續提升，直到晚年才逐漸下降。這也是為什麼許多年長者彷彿成為智慧的寶庫。
* It is characterized by the ability to leverage accumulated knowledge, experience, skills, and insights.
* Crystallized Intelligence represents the intelligence of _experience_. It begins to rise as Fluid Intelligence declines, with the compounding accumulation of knowledge accelerating during later career years.

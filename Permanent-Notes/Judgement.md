> _“Good judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgment.” — Rita Mae Brown_

> _“A good judgment is usually the result of experience. And experience is frequently the result of bad judgment. But to learn from the experience of others requires those who have the experience to share the knowledge with those who follow.” ― Henry Petroski, [To Engineer Is Human: The Role of Failure in Successful Design](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/263211)_

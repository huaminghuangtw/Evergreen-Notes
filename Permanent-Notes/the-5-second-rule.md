The idea is simple:

> Instead of saying _“I should do this”_ and letting your brain argue with you, you count down **5–4–3–2–1** (or **3–2–1**) and **physically move immediately**.

No debate. No motivation check. [Just immediate action.](cultivate-a-strong-bias-towards-action.md)

Your brain has a built-in hesitation loop:

> _“I should get up… but I’m tired… maybe later… I’ll check my phone first…”_

Counting down interrupts that loop.

It shifts control from your emotional brain (fear, comfort, procrastination) to your action system.

It’s basically a **force override button** for inertia.

# Examples

* Getting out of bed
	→ _3…2…1… stand up_
* Starting a hard task
	→ _3…2…1… open the document_
* Going for a run
	→ _3…2…1… put on shoes_

The rule:

**Don’t think about it, just start doing it. You must move before your brain starts negotiating.**

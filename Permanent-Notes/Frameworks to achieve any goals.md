# [The 30-for-30 Approach — Sahil Bloom](https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/how-to-change-your-life-in-30-days)

* In any area in which you want to make progress, do the thing for 30 minutes per day for 30 straight days.
* Anyone can find 30 minutes in their day to focus on something they care about making progress on:
	* First thing in the morning
	* During your lunch break
	* At the end of the work day
	* Before going to bed
* 30 days of 30 minutes per day is 900 total minutes (i.e., 15 hours) of accumulated, focused, dedicated effort, which creates a marathon of short, manageable sprints.

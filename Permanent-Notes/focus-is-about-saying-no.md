Since focus requires [saying no](If%20it%20isn’t%20fuck%20YES,%20then%20it’s%20clear%20NO%20thank%20you.md), it also means what smart people and strong competitors are saying no to are usually great ideas/opportunities.

* If you're trying to find your way in an organization, it's worth thinking about the most focused people around you and asking them about the best idea they're not working on.
* If you're a company, it's worth thinking about what your strongest competition is not doing.
* _[“When competing against the incumbent, better to focus on what they won't do rather than what they can't do.” — Naval Ravikant](https://x.com/naval/status/745430655077486594)_

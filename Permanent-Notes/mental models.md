A bunch of different mental habits can come together/team up to strongly steer your mind towards a particular course of action and create a big impact ([The Lollapalooza Effect](the-lollapalooza-effect.md))

# What Are Mental Models?

They are…

* to your brain as apps are to your smartphone
* thinking tools in our mental toolbox, guiding our thoughts and behaviors \& driving our responses to everything we experience
* shortcuts for reasoning
* frameworks that give people a mental representation (心智表徵) of how the world works

# Benefits

* helps us to see the underlying patterns (脈絡) in every area of life
* helps us to spot the signal in the noise
* helps us to identify the blind spots in our thinking and thus think better (critically \& creatively \& connectively)
* helps us to view the world from different lens/eyes/perspectives, to make sense of the world

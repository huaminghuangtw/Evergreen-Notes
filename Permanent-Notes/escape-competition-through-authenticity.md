> “The eyes of others our prisons; their thoughts our cages.” — Virginia Woolf

> “If you want to be successful in life, simply watch what most people would do in a given situation, and then [do the total opposite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y_6fZGSOQI)—nine times out of ten, you’ll receive greater rewards.” — Earl Nightingale

> “The world wants you to be typical — in a thousand ways, it pulls at you. Don’t let it happen. You have to pay a price for your distinctiveness, and it’s worth it.” — Jeff Bezos

> [“Don’t try to emulate. It’s a fool’s errand. Instead, each person is uniquely qualified at something. They have some specific knowledge, capability, and desire nobody else in the world does, purely from the combinatorics of human DNA and development.” — Naval Ravikant](https://nav.al/competition-authenticity)

# The Fight Against Normalcy

> “Normal is the average of deviance.” — Rita Mae Brown

> “If you are always trying to be normal you will never know how amazing you can be.” — Maya Angelou

* Maintaining your uniqueness in a world that pulls you to blend in, is the only way to realize your full potential and live a fulfilled, texture-rich existence.
* It comes with a risk, but the rewards are abundant. It may come with a steep cost in the short-term, but the long-term rewards are worth it.

> “Be weird. Your strangeness is your magic.” — Parker Lewis

The things that make you weird are often the things that make you memorable. Lean into your Pattern Interrupts.

Normal behavior is forgotten. Only weird behavior survives. _Nobody tells stories of when you did the expected — they only tell stories when you did the unexpected._ Normalize being weird. Weirdness is what sets us apart, makes us unique. Be your unapologetically weird self. In fact, being weird may even find you the ultimate happiness.

1. If you pay for the bill at everyone in the table — the short-term reaction is shock and confusion. In the long term, it’s everyone’s favorite memory of you.
2. If you travel across the world for a friend’s birthday, the friend’s initial reaction is: “You don’t have to do that” — but it’s the story they tell at your funeral.
3. If you’re 100% honest with your feedback on people’s business ideas, the short-term reaction is anger. In the long term, you become one of the few people they trust.

# Uncondition/Undo yourself

Sometimes becoming who you are is actually about _unbecoming_ who you aren’t.

The world doesn’t need one more _template_. It needs one more _rebel_.

找到只有你能做得好的一件事，你就會事半功倍，最後你將成為那件事的世界第一，並且熱愛生命

What you are good at is different from what you are genetically encoded for.

Find a thing that’s so you, that doing it is just a natural extension of you being yourself.

[Your best performances will come when you are working in a way that is a full expression of you. The work becomes a natural display of your personality. This is when you not only get better results, but also love the activity — because in doing the craft, you feel alive.](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/january-30-2025)

如果無法為自己規劃願景，只會一昧地跟隨他人的夢想、隨之起舞，到最後，二流永遠只能是二流，追隨者也終究無法超越跟隨的腳步。

人注定要成功。每個人都很獨特，天生就具備與眾不同的能力與特質。成功來自於 [發現真正的自己](mastering-yourself-is-superpower.md)，開發自己尚未開發的潛能。而發揮潛能，靠得不是忍受每天的磨練，而是把每天的磨練轉變成日常快樂的泉源（「刻意玩樂 Deliberate Play」）。

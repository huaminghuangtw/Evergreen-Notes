[The anchoring effect](https://sketchplanations.com/anchoring) is a cognitive bias where people rely too heavily on the first piece of information (the “anchor”) when [making decisions](decision-making.md).

Once an anchor is set, subsequent judgments are made by adjusting away from that anchor, and there is a bias toward interpreting other information around it.

# Examples

* In negotiations, the first price mentioned often sets the tone for the rest of the discussion, even if it is arbitrary.
* When a credit card statement suggests a minimum payment of $25, many people focus on that number and pay only the minimum—even, even if they could afford more.
* Retailers use “original price” tags to anchor perceptions of value, making discounts seem more significant.

In 1971, Dr. Philip Zimbardo conducted a psychological study famously known as the “[Stanford Prison Experiment](https://exhibits.stanford.edu/spe).”

This experiment revealed _how ordinary, well-intentioned individuals could be influenced by situational forces to commit harmful actions_, and _how mentally healthy participants could develop pathological reactions_.

It highlighted the profound impact of social situations on human behavior.

In 1971, Dr. Philip Zimbardo conducted a psychological study famously known as the “[Stanford Prison Experiment](https://exhibits.stanford.edu/spe).”

This experiment revealed _how ordinary, well-intentioned individuals could be influenced by situational forces to commit harmful actions_, and _how mentally healthy participants could develop pathological reactions_.

The study took place in the basement of Stanford University’s psychology department, where college students were randomly assigned to play the roles of either guards or prisoners in a simulated prison environment. The experiment was originally planned to last two weeks but was terminated after only six days due to the extreme and disturbing behaviors that emerged.

Participants quickly adapted to their assigned roles: guards became increasingly authoritarian and abusive, while prisoners became passive, anxious, and emotionally distressed. The psychological effects were so severe that some prisoners experienced breakdowns, and the guards’ actions escalated to the point of inflicting psychological harm.

The Stanford Prison Experiment demonstrated how easily people can conform to social roles and expectations, especially when those roles are supported by institutional power and anonymity. It raised important ethical questions about research in psychology and led to greater scrutiny of experimental design and participant welfare.

The findings have been widely discussed in the fields of social psychology, ethics, and criminal justice, illustrating the dangers of unchecked authority and the vulnerability of individuals to situational pressures. The experiment remains a powerful example of how context and environment can override personal morals and identity.

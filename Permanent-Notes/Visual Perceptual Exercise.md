This is a useful tool for our nervous system to manage [stress](stress%20and%20anxiety.md) and enhancing cognitive flexibility.

Steps

1. Start with eyes closed, focusing on the internal state of body sensations like breathing and heart rate (_Fine/Thin Time Slicing_)
2. Then eyes open, focusing on the surface of one’s body.
3. Gradually look further into the distance, expanding your perception from near to far, maybe 10 feet away.
4. Then look at a location off to the horizon. Imagine yourself in a broader context, [like viewing the whole world or the entire globe.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overview_effect) (_Coarse/Thick Time Slicing_)
5. And then back to one’s immediate surroundings by closing one’s eyes.

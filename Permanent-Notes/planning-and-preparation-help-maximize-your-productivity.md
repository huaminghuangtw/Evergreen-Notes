前置作業

---

Failure to prepare means preparing to fail.

---

Preparation converts [chance](luck.md) into results.

Planning and [doing](cultivate-a-strong-bias-towards-action.md) are two different modes of operation. **Separate planning from doing.** [^1] Spend some time on _[task value/priority evaluation/assessment](Prioritization.md)_ before any commitments/effort. It’s worth it. [^2]

❗️Be aware of [the difference between “being in motion” and “taking action”](https://jamesclear.com/taking-action) [^3]

❗Too much → [Procrastination](procrastination.md)

> _“Patience only works if you do. Doing the work + patience = results. Planning to work + patience = procrastination” — James Clear_

# Preparation Always Beats Planning

* Planning is based on the expectation of order. Preparation is based on the expectation of chaos.
* Plan for order and you’ll be destroyed by chaos. Prepare for chaos and you’ll thrive in any condition.

No matter how often I tried to just jump right in a new task, I found that I performed my best when I invested a little bit of time in formulating a plan—By defining some CLARITY before starting something saves me a huge amount of time later on.

**Mise en place** is a French culinary phrase which means “putting in place” or “gather”. It refers to the setup required before cooking, and is often used in professional kitchens to refer to organizing and arranging the ingredients (e.g., cuts of meat, relishes, sauces, par-cooked items, spices, freshly chopped vegetables, and other components) that a cook will require for the menu items.

[When fisherman cannot go to sea, they repair nets. When the sea is too rough to sail, the smart ones don’t wait—they get to work. They mend their nets, sharpen their tools, and prepare for the moment the storm breaks. Because even in stillness, there’s progress.](https://x.com/drex_dsgn/status/1875141626513002885)

It’s not about idling; it’s about using the pause to build [what comes next](just-focus-on-the-next-decision.md).

* The Pilot (10% of the day) → Planning
* The Plane (85% of the day) → Execution
* The Engineer (5% of the day) → [Review](reflect-and-review.md)

* **Goal (完成的標準)**
	* Facts (完成任務時必須達成的具體標準或數據指標)
		* _What are the facts when I complete the goal?_
	* Feeling (完成任務後，團隊成員應該感受到的心理狀態)
		* _What do I expect to feel once I’ve completed the goal?_
	* Functionality (任務完成後，應能如何幫助他人)
		* _Why do I care for the goal in the first place?_
* **Plan**
	* _What’s the plan that I am going to follow to get to the goal?_
	* _What are the 3 to 5 major chess moves that I am going to do to get to the goal?_
* **System**
	* _What do I need to do everyday / every week that will help me stick to the plan and achieve the goal?_

[Implementation Intentions](implementation-intentions.md)

[^1]: [Separate decision from implementation](https://tim.blog/2023/03/01/matt-mochary/)
[^2]: **[Cognitive Miser](https://www.google.com/search?q=Cognitive+Miser)** — The tendency of human minds to think and solve problems in simpler and less effortful ways, rather than in more sophisticated and effortful ways, regardless of intelligence. → 在其他條件與因素不變的情況下，我們通常傾向選擇最省力的路徑。由於那些無意識且熟練的神經例行程序運行起來輕鬆自如，而需要深思熟慮的有意識決策則較為費神，身為認知吝嗇者，只要尚可應對，我們往往依賴自動化的神經例行程序，而非投入心力進行有意識的決策。而在執行神經例行程序的動作時，我們往往會進入出神的狀態。[Merriam-Webster's Dictionary 對「出神 (trance)」的定義之一是: 「一種使你因專注於其他事物而未察覺周遭變化的狀態。」](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trance)
[^3]: Motion will never produce a final result. Action will. Always choose action over motion.

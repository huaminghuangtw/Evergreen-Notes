**TL; DR** Default to NO.

> _[“Raise the bar as high as possible, and say no to anything that you feel less than ‘Hell yeah, that’ll be amazing!’” — Derek Sivers, Hell Yeah or No](https://sive.rs/hellyeah)_

> _[“When you say no, you are only saying no to one option. When you say yes, you are saying no to every other option. No is a decision. Yes is a responsibility. Be careful what (and who) you say yes to. It will shape your day, your career, your family, your life.” — James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/saying-no)_ [^1]

> _“We need to learn the slow ‘yes’ and the quick ‘no.’” — Tom Friel, the former CEO of Heidrick & Struggles_

> _“Half of the troubles of this life can be traced to saying yes too quickly and not saying no soon enough.” — Josh Billings_

Say NO (resist) to protect your YES (persist)

Saying yes to everything is a quick road / recipe to mediocrity

* Why is it so hard for us to see this? [Inertia](be-ready-to-change-your-mind-completely-at-any-given-time.md), for one. [Ego](abandon-your-ego.md), for another.

Before you say “yes” or “no”, just **pause**. This simple pause gives you control over your choices, allowing you to [respond with intention rather than reflex](choose-your-response.md).

# Do More With Less

> _“My goal is no longer to get more done, but rather to have less to do.” ― Francine Jay_

> _[“We are most productive when we focus on a very small number of projects on which we can devote a large amount of attention.” — Cal Newport](slow-productivity.md)_

* The goal is to achieve more by doing less, and the only way to get more things done is to have fewer things to do. Remember: [The more things you do, the less well you do each of them.](https://www.workingtheorys.com/p/3-hours) The less you have to do, the more time you get to chase randomness and enjoy the things you really want to do.
* Less is often more—but getting to “less” is the hard part.
* [Being overwhelmed](Burnout.md) is just as unproductive as doing nothing—and far more unpleasant. [Productivity](Productivity.md) comes from being selective: do less, but focus on what truly matters. [Prioritize](Prioritization.md) the vital few and ignore the rest.

# The 3-hours-or-nothing Rule

**[Don’t agree to anything “quick” unless you’re willing to spend 3+ hours on it.](https://www.workingtheorys.com/p/3-hours)**

When you follow this rule, your priorities get clear, you procrastinate less, you’re more focused and more productive, and time management becomes a lot easier. You say “no” a LOT more. And the “yes” becomes a lot more emphatic. You find yourself less stressed, less overthinking about the past and less anxious about the future.

承諾就像灌木叢，需要定期修剪。給出任何承諾前，先問自己能不能全情投入。

# [The “Yes-Damn” Effect](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CxDR2m2gFAt/)

* You say, “Yes,” and then the future date arrives, and you say, “Damn!”
	* We often say yes to things assuming that we will have more time or energy for them in the future. But when that future date arrives, we regret it.
* As a rule of thumb, if you’re going to say yes to anything because you think you’ll have more time or energy for it in the future, say no instead!

# The Right Now Test By Sahil Bloom

When deciding whether to take on a new commitment, ask yourself, “_Would I do this right now?_” Think of right now as today or tomorrow. The aim is to eliminate the future time distortions observed by psychologists; by pulling the event into the present, you make a more clear, rational decision.

* If the answer is no, say no.
* If the answer is yes, take it on.

Examples:

* There is no code faster than no code.
* There is no meeting that goes faster than not having a meeting at all.

Two-factor authentication against your calendar by Naval Ravikant

* Say no over and over again to the unimportant things flying in our direction every day and remaining focused on saying yes to the few things that truly matter.

> _“Productivity is most important for things you don’t want to be doing. Most people want to increase productivity so they can spend less time on the task. But before you worry about being more productive, think about being more selective. Rather than focusing on increasing productivity, it may be worth asking, ‘What would I be delighted to spend time on, even if it went slowly?’ Direct your energy toward figuring out how to start what you want to do rather than thinking about how to shorten what you don’t want to do.” — James Clear_

> _“Productivity isn’t really about getting more things done, it’s mostly about learning to [enjoy the journey](journey-over-destination.md) — because when we’re having fun with things we’re doing, then productivity takes care of itself.” — Ali Abdaal_

Productivity is about…

* living each moment to its fullest
* minimizing waste [^1]
* spending time with intent(ionality)
* using our time in a way that’s intentional, effective and enjoyable
* doing _something_, but not _everything_

Productivity is not only a _measure of [efficiency](what-you-work-on-is-far-more-important-than-how-productively-you-work.md)_ and also a _state of mind/attitude_ ([consciously choosing what really matters to](Prioritization.md) [focus on](focus-is-about-saying-no.md))

---

Productivity

= (_High-Quality Output_ / Time Spent) [^2] × Fun Factor

= (_Time Spent × **Intensity** of [Focus](focus-is-about-saying-no.md)_ / Time Spent) × Fun Factor

= _**Intensity**_ of [Focus](focus-is-about-saying-no.md) × Fun Factor [^3]

Fill your day with hope and face it with joy. Do bold things with a pleasant and friendly demeanor. Enjoyment is time\& energy efficiency. When you’re enjoying yourself, productivity takes care of itself. When work feels like play, the world becomes your playground. 😊

❗Toxic Productivity / Productivity Porn [^4]❗

Hot take: Most “productivity” tools are actually “[procrastination](procrastination.md)” tools in disguise.

The only thing that actually works (for me) in productivity is **easy systems** with **shorts ways**.

---

Keep in mind: An effective [system](Systems%20over%20goals.md) requires simple, repeatable subroutines that can be performed automatically and integrate seamlessly with one another. True transformation occurs only when these individual building blocks align within a cohesive, interconnected workflow, with bottlenecks identified and eliminated. This is why the typical “10 Tools to Improve Your Productivity” tips found all over the internet rarely offer lasting value. Instead, you need to build your own [system](Systems%20over%20goals.md) that aligns with your unique needs. Experiment and find what works best for you.

# [Newton’s Three Laws of Productivity](https://jamesclear.com/physics-productivity)

1. Objects in motion tend to stay in motion. Find a way to get started in less than 2 minutes.
2. It’s not just about working hard (magnitude), it’s also about working on the right things (direction). You have a limited amount of force and where you apply it matters.
3. Your productivity is a balance of opposing forces. If you want to be more productive, you can either _power through the barriers_ or _remove the opposing forces_. The second option seems to be less stressful.

[@ferriss4hourWorkweekEscape2011]

There are two synergistic approaches for increasing productivity that are inversions of each other:

1. Limit tasks to the important to shorten work time ([The Pareto Principle](the-pareto-principle.md)).
2. Shorten work time to limit tasks to the important ([The Parkinson’s Law](the-parkinsons-law.md)).

[^1]: Productivity can be redefined as minimizing waste in various aspects of life, such as time, energy, attention, ideas, and one’s potential. → [Lean Thinking](https://www.google.com/search?q=Lean+Thinking)
[^2]: Increased productivity is creating more value in less time. It’s about getting the _right_ things done, not the _most_ things done. The goal isn’t to generate prolific _output_, but to generate prolific _output per unit input_. It’s about the leverage on your input.
[^3]: It’s not about the number of hours you put in. It’s about the _quality_ of those hours.
[^4]: Productivity porn refers to the obsession with consuming content and strategies about productivity rather than actually being productive. It tricks you into feeling productive when in reality you didn’t actually do anything productive. By focusing on the appearance of being productive (e.g., perfect planners, aesthetic workspaces), individuals may neglect the actual work that drives results or moves the needle. Productivity porn creates an endless loop of preparation. This term highlights how people often spend time reading books, watching videos, or engaging with tools and systems about productivity instead of applying these methods in practice. The abundance of advice can overwhelm users, making it harder to choose and stick to a single approach, leading to frustration and decision fatigue.

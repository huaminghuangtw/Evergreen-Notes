> _“You don’t rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Your goal is your desired outcome. Your system is the collection of daily habits that will get you there.” — James Clear_ [^1]

> _“A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at.” — Bruce Lee_

* The worthwhile properties of systems derive from the interactions/connections of its parts.
* The power of systems comes from _the cause and effect (i.e., the upstream and downstream)_, which only works when it’s combined and inter-related as an entity.

**Examples**
* The magic of a car is not how its components (engine, doors, tires, seats) work, it’s how the whole car works together within the larger transportation system, i.e., it gets you from point A to point B with a certain speed, comfort level, carrying capacity etc. A car is compared with other systems (bus, train, airplane) by how they each fit into the transportation system.
* The value of a [note-taking](note-taking.md) system is not just in how individual tools or methods (pen and paper, digital apps, outlining, mind mapping) function in isolation, but in how they collectively enhance your ability to capture, organize, and retrieve information efficiently. The system is evaluated by how it integrates into your broader learning or working process—helping you absorb information, recall it when needed, and connect ideas over time.
* A productivity system is not simply about the efficiency of individual habits ([The Pomodoro Technique](the-pomodoro-technique.md), Time-blocking, etc.) or tools (To-do lists, Calendars, Reminders, etc.), but about how these elements interact to create a flow that helps you balance tasks, prioritize effectively, and stay focused within the broader context of your personal and professional life.

Key step to build an effective system that function smoothly: Identify the (especially fractal) **patterns** by distinguishing linear (non-essential) from circular (essential)

Systems allow you to [make a decision](decision-making.md) _one time_ instead of _hundreds (or even thousands) of times_. [^2] Anytime you [make one decision](decision-making.md) that reduces the number of decisions you need to make in the future, you are creating a system.

# Systems v.s Goals

* Goals are for people who care about winning once. Systems are for people who care about winning over and over again.
* When you focus on systems, the goal is no longer the _destination_—it’s simply a byproduct of the _[process](journey-over-destination.md)_, allowing you to keep succeeding even after reaching it.
* Goals are compasses and good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress.
* These two concepts are not mutually exclusive because a goal alone accomplishes nothing. Ultimately, the system demands more effort, but the goal remains essential to the process—you can’t have one without the other!
	* Long-term vision. Short-term actions.
	* Macro patience. Micro speed.
	* Impatience with actions. Patience with results.

Outcome-focused goals had a negligible effect, while process/behavior-focused goals had a profound effect.

In simple terms, those who consistently focused on the inputs performed better than those who focused on the outcomes.

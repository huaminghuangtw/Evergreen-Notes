> There was an old man who lived in a village in India. Every morning, he would place a long stick across his back, hang a water pot from each end, and walk several miles to the river to get fresh water for his family.
> 
> But the two water pots were not the same. One had a series of small cracks in its side, causing it to leak.
> 
> The old man would fill both pots at the river, but by the time he got back to his home, the cracked pot would be half empty, the water having leaked out during the walk.
> 
> The cracked pot grew increasingly ashamed of its inability to complete the task for which it was made. One day, while the old man filled the two pots at the river, the cracked pot spoke to him.
> 
> “I’m sorry. I’m so embarrassed that I cannot fulfill my responsibilities as well as the other pot.”
> 
> The old man smiled and replied, “On the walk home today, rather than hanging your head in shame, I want you to look up at the side of the path.”
> 
> The cracked pot reluctantly agreed to do as the old man asked. As they left the riverbank and started on the path, he couldn’t believe his eyes.
> 
> On his side of the path was a beautiful row of flowers.
> 
> “You see,” the old man said, “I’ve always known you had those cracks, so I planted flower seeds along your side of the path. Each day, your cracks helped me water them. And now, I pick these flowers to share their beauty with the entire village.”


You are the cracked pot. Perfectly imperfect. Remember that.

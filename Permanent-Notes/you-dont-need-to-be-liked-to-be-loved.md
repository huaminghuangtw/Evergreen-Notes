Sometimes when you say no to others it opens a pathway to a hell yes for yourself. To grow, you have to disappoint some people. [Saying no](if-it-isnt-fuck-yes-then-its-clear-no-thank-you.md) is a form of self-respect. Don’t be the one to tell yourself no.

做一個不怕讓人失望的人。這個世界上對你不好的人，不差你一個；這個世界上對你好的人，就差你一個。

Stop people-pleasing. Everyone thinking you’re great means nothing, if you don’t think you’re great. Be impressive to others is overrated. Be impressive to yourself. You don’t need to impress anyone but yourself. You become inhumanly strong when you try to impress only one person: YOU. You are always going to win the “YOU” game. The only person you have to compete against is yourself. You learn the most when there is nobody to cheer you but yourself.

> _“When you say yes to others, make sure you are not saying no to yourself.” — Paulo Coelho_

---

Sometimes when you say no to others it opens a pathway to a hell yes for yourself. To grow, you have to disappoint some people. Saying no is a form of self-respect. Don’t be the one to tell yourself no.

---

Stop people-pleasing. Everyone thinking you’re great means nothing, if you don’t think you’re great. Be impressive to others is overrated. Be impressive to yourself. You don’t need to impress anyone but yourself. You become inhumanly strong when you try to impress only one person: YOU. You are always going to win the “YOU” game. The only person you have to compete against is yourself. You learn the most when there is nobody to cheer you but yourself.

There is no sure path to success, but the surest path to failure is trying to please everyone.

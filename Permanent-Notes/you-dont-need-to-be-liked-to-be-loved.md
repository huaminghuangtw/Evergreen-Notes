Sometimes when you say no to others it opens a pathway to a hell yes for yourself. To grow, you have to disappoint some people. [Saying no](if-it-isnt-fuck-yes-then-its-clear-no-thank-you.md) is a form of self-respect. Don’t be the one to tell yourself no.

做一個不怕讓人失望的人。這個世界上對你不好的人，不差你一個；這個世界上對你好的人，就差你一個。

如果你的善良讓你不斷消耗自己，那你的善良就變成了一種對自己的殘忍。

真正的好人，不會為了討好別人而過度付出，他們只做自己承擔得起的善行。

真正的善良，不是靠迎合，而源於自知與自重。

真正的善良，不是盲目的討好，而是清醒的選擇。

真正的善良，不是沒有底線的付出，而是有分寸的給予。

真正的善良，不是為了被喜歡，而是為了不愧對自己的心。

Stop people-pleasing. Everyone thinking you’re great means nothing, if you don’t think you’re great. Be impressive to others is overrated. Be impressive to yourself. You don’t need to impress anyone but yourself. You become inhumanly strong when you try to impress only one person: YOU. You are always going to win the “YOU” game. The only person you have to compete against is yourself. You learn the most when there is nobody to cheer you but yourself.

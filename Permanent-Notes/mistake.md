Once is a mistake. Twice is a choice. Three times is a decision.

 「知錯」是一種智慧，「糾錯」是一種勇氣，「除錯」則是一連串假設及驗證的過程。

Your goal is not to avoid making mistakes, but to [avoid making the _same_ mistake and keep making _new_ mistakes](https://kk.org/thetechnium/103-bits-of-advice-i-wish-i-had-known/).

A [failure](Failing%20forward%20turns%20setbacks%20into%20stepping%20stones.md) is not always a mistake, it may simply be the best one can do under the circumstances. The real mistake is to [stop trying](Fear%20of%20Failure%20and%20Success.md). Every single failure is a lesson. It only becomes real failure if you learn nothing from it.

If you can’t beat the fear, do it scared.

If you want something, do it. If you want something, but you’re scared, do it scared.

If we’re controlled by fear, we’re in the mode of ignorance.

[Reframe](a-true-transformation-begins-with-a-mental-shift.md) fear as an information gap. Gather information and conquer your fears.

# Naval Ravikant

* _“90% of our thoughts are fear-based. 10% of our thoughts are [desire](the-absence-of-desire-is-true-happiness.md)-based.”_
* _“I think it’s not we fear [death](death.md). It’s we fear not [living the life that we want](how-to-live-a-life.md). And I think the easiest way to get out of that is to [start living the life you want](intentional-living.md) [now](live-in-the-present.md), not putting/frittering it off.”_
	* This will make you feel that life is long, and you will be less afraid of [dying](death.md).

> _[“Shallow rivers are noisy. Deep lakes are silent.” — Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/h)_

> _“They blame those who remain silent, they blame those who speak much, they blame those who speak in moderation. There is none in the world who is not blamed.” — Gautama Buddha_

> _“We assume that the more arguments we give, the better our case. In reality, our weakest arguments dilute the strongest. Generally, you’ll only be as convincing as your worst point, so instead of making as many arguments as you can, make only the best.” — Gurwinder Bhogal_

The less you speak, the more you [listen](Active%20Listening.md) (and learn).

---

Talking is mentally taxing. Be still, less chatty. Keep your mouth shut as often as possible.

---

Remember: You have two ears and one mouth. Therefore, you should listen twice as much as you speak.

Always speak less than necessary. [@greene48LawsPower2000]

> _“I have noticed that nothing I never said ever did me any harm.” — Calvin Coolidge_

* When you are trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the more common you appear, and the less in control. Even if you are saying something banal, it will seem original if you make it vague, open-ended, and sphinx-like. Powerful people impress and intimidate by saying less. The more you say, the more likely you are to say something foolish.
* The move _[Friday Night Lights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CZ-ICxcEYg)_ has a famous scene where a notoriously quiet player gives a riveting speech that turns around a game. He rarely spoke up, so when he did, it hit. Hard. If you want to be heard, talk less. You’ll find more power in your words.

Small streams make the most noise; great rivers flow in silence.

What is not full rattles loudly; what is full rests quiet.

The sea is pure only in its depths.

Silence is more eloquent than [words](Be%20impeccable%20with%20your%20word.md). Silence speaks volumes.

> _“Blessed is the man, who having nothing to say, abstains from giving wordy evidence of the fact.” — George Eliot_

* 寧可保持沉默像個傻子，也不要一開口就證明自己是個傻瓜。
* 全世界最令人討厭的事，大概就是說個不停、話講個沒完。
* 「懂得內斂，學會矜持」: 大部分的孔雀都不會在人前開屏，人們稱這是孔雀的矜持。
 * You always own the option of not having an opinion on things you aren’t informed on.
* It’s ok not to have no opinions — _[as long as you avoid the temptation to prove it](abandon-your-ego.md)_.

---

Speak confidently. [Listen](Active%20Listening.md) carefully.

* Speak in such a way that others love to listen to you. Listen in such a way that others love to speak to you.

# Think Before You SPEAK(, And Read Before You THINK.)

* _“If it is not right, do not do it; if it is not true, do not say it.” — Marcus Aurelius_
* _“First learn the meaning of what you say, and then speak.” — Epictetus Marcus_

---

Some questions to consider before you speak:

 * “_Does this need to be said?_”
 * “_Does this need to be said by me?_”
 * “_Does this need to be said by me right now?_”

* The quietest person in the room often has the most to say.
* The quietest person in the room is usually listening the hardest.
* The quietest person in the room speaks loudest when it matters.
* The quietest person in the room already understands what others are still trying to prove.

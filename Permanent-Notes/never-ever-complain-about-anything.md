> _“If it’s endurable, then endure it. Stop complaining. If it’s unendurable … then stop complaining. Your destruction will mean its end as well. Just remember: you can endure anything your mind can make endurable, by treating it as in your interest to do so. In your interest, or in your nature.” — Marcus Aurelius_

> _“He who blames others has a long way to go on his journey. He who blames himself is halfway there. He who blames no one has arrived.”_（「怨人者途遠，責己者行半，無戾者已至，此之謂也。」—《左傳 · 昭公十五年》）

[Don't complain about anything. If it's within your control, go do something about it (either change the situation or change your attitude.). If it's not, complaining is just a waste of energy. When you complain, you're giving too much power to the thing. Take back that power.](https://x.com/SahilBloom/status/1761376505874219427)

Whatever it is, it’s your fault. Take the extreme ownership. (扛全責/負起所有責任) Nobody owes you anything at all. Develop a no-excuses mindset.

> _“Excuses are the rocks where our dreams are crushed.” — Tim Fargo_

* When something goes wrong, own it, fix it, and prevent it from happening again.
* Never make excuses. Excuses don’t get results.
* As soon as I catch myself blaming anyone for anything, I decide it’s my fault/responsibility.
* **Remember: You give power to who you blame. Never give your power to anyone else.**

# If it’s always someone else’s fault, it’s probably your fault.

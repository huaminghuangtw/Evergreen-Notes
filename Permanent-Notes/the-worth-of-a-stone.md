> One day, a boy approached his father and asked, “What is my life worth?”
>
> The father handed his son a small stone and replied, “Take this stone to the market. If anyone asks the price, raise two fingers and don’t say anything.”
>
> The boy did as he was told and went to the market. An old woman approached him and asked, “How much is that rock? I want it for my garden.”
>
> The boy held up two fingers, to which the woman replied, “$2? I’ll take it.”
>
> Before she could complete the deal, the boy turned and ran home to tell his father what had happened.
>
> His father nodded and said, “Ok, now take the stone to the museum. If anyone asks the price, raise two fingers and don’t say anything.”
>
> The boy did as he was told and went to the museum. A man in a suit approached him and asked, “How much is that stone? I want it for my home.”
>
> The boy held up two fingers, to which the man replied, “$200? I’ll take it.”
>
> Before he could complete the deal, the boy turned and ran home to tell his father what had happened.
>
> His father nodded and said, “Ok, now take the stone to the precious gem store. If the owner asks the price, raise two fingers and don’t say anything.”
>
> The boy did as he was told and went to the stone store. The owner of the store approached him and asked, “Where did you find that rare stone? I have been looking for it my entire life. How much will you sell it for?”
>
> The boy held up two fingers, to which the man replied, “$20,000? I’ll take it.”
>
> The boy was shocked when the old man offered him $20,000 for the stone. He quickly returned to his father and shared the incident.
>
> With a smile, the father replied, **“Look, son, someone who knows the value of a stone has offered you the highest amount because he recognizes it’s true worth.”**

# Takeaways

1. 不要因為被低估就懷疑自己的價值。
2. 不要停留在只願意出「2 美元」的地方，學會選擇環境，因為環境會放大或掩蓋你的光芒。
3. 重點不是你有多好，而是找到能看見你價值的地方與人。
4. [你不需要向任何人證明自己的價值，特別是那些「不在乎」你的人。你的價值，從來就不是來自他人的認可，而是來自你的存在本身。努力取悅無關緊要的人，只會讓你忽略真正在乎你的人。專注於那些真的在乎你、看見你、支持你的人，他們才值得你投入時間與能量。](https://readingoutpost.com/newsletter-2025-01-29/)

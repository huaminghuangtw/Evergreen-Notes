我們始終擁有「選擇權」— 選擇不受外在任何人事物影響情緒的權利。

只要我們夠愛自己、夠尊敬自己、夠重視自己的快樂和內心的平靜，情緒便能真正自由。

# [Two Types of Emotional Freedom](https://chengweihu.com/emotional-freedom/)

| Internal Emotional Freedom | External Emotional Freedom |
| :---: | :---: |
| The “freedom from” being controlled by inner urges and drives | The “freedom to” express yourself and take action without external constraints. |

📌 What you have to remember about the past is that it literally _does not_ exist—it exists _only_ in your mind, in your memories, no more real than a daydream. And here’s the thing: **your memories are likely far less accurate than you think.** They’re shaped by your emotions, your state of mind at the time, and the way your brain processes and stores information. Your mind exaggerates some details, completely erases others, and distorts events without you even realizing it.

Someone who experienced the exact same event as you likely remembers it very differently. Memories are _not_ objective facts, and they _cannot_ be fully trusted. Yet, we build our sense of self from these flawed recollections—we construct a story of our lives based on memories that may not be true at all.

**But if the past no longer exists, and if what you remember isn’t necessarily what really happened, that means you have the power to [rewrite it](a-true-transformation-begins-with-a-mental-shift.md).** Change [the story you tell yourself about yourself.](be-careful-how-you-are-talking-to-yourself.md) Redefine your past, and in doing so, reshape who you are.

## 🔑 Key Insights & Takeaways

1. **Thoughts are not facts.**
	* Most of our emotional pain is caused by the thoughts we believe, not the reality itself.
	* Thoughts can be misleading, biased, and irrational—don’t accept them at face value.
2. **You are not your thoughts.**
	* You are the awareness _behind_ your thoughts. Realizing this creates distance between you and your mental noise.
	* Consciousness is your true identity, not the stream of thinking.
3. **Suffering comes from resistance.**
	* Negative emotions are not inherently bad; they become problematic when we resist or identify with them.
	* Acceptance and non-judgment lead to [inner peace](Peace%20from%20mind.md).
4. **Happiness is our natural state.**
	* When we stop believing painful, limiting thoughts, what’s left is inner peace and contentment.
	* Nothing needs to be “added” to be happy—it’s uncovered by removing mental clutter.
5. **Let go of needing to control everything.**
	* The need to control your thoughts, emotions, or outcomes only deepens suffering.
	* Trusting life and surrendering to the present moment creates flow.
6. **Overthinking is a symptom of trying to solve imaginary problems.**
	* Most of our stress comes from mentally rehearsing situations that haven’t happened.
	* Focus on what’s real—what you’re experiencing _now_.
7. **Limiting beliefs keep you stuck.**
	* Thoughts like “I’m not good enough” are learned, not true.
	* Question these beliefs and realize you’re more than your conditioning.

## ✅ Actionable Tips & Advice

1. **Practice being the observer.**
	* Regularly notice your thoughts [without judgment](Dispel%20your%20narratives.md). Say to yourself, “There’s a thought that…” to create separation.
2. **Use mindfulness to stay grounded.**
	* Anchor yourself in the [present moment](live-in-the-present.md) using your breath, body, or senses.
	* [Meditation](meditation.md) is a helpful tool, but simple awareness throughout the day works too.
3. **Ask: “Is this true?”**
	* When a painful thought arises, question its validity. Often, you’ll find it’s just a story, not a fact.
4. **Don’t resist emotions.**
	* [Allow emotions to pass through you like waves, without suppressing or clinging to them.](Acceptance%20and%20Commitment%20Therapy.md)
	* Labeling emotions (e.g., “This is anxiety”) helps reduce their intensity.
5. **Write your thoughts down.**
	* [Journaling](Journaling.md) helps you see patterns and detach from negative thinking.
	* Use prompts like: _What am I thinking right now? Is it helpful or true?_
6. **Let go of the need to be right.**
	* Many thoughts are attempts to control or protect the ego. [Letting go of mental arguments](Dispel%20your%20narratives.md) brings peace.
7. **Embrace stillness and silence.**
	* Spend time away from distractions to reconnect with your deeper self and hear your inner wisdom.
8. **Understand that healing is subtractive, not additive.**
	* [You don’t need more information](Information%20Overwhelm.md), success, or approval. You need less attachment to thoughts and beliefs.

# [Nonchalant](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/nonchalant)

* “Nonchalantly Aware”
	* Being fully present without appearing overly concerned
	* 看起來 [毫不「在意」](Not%20caring%20lets%20us%20perform%20better.md)，但卻是完全地「注意」
* In spirituality, the concept of being nonchalant…
	* often refers to a state of inner calm and detachment. It is not about being careless or [indifferent](Have%20the%20courage%20to%20do%20the%20right%20things.md) in a negative sense but rather cultivating an attitude of equanimity, where one is not overly disturbed by external circumstances or emotional fluctuations.
	* is about embracing the art of **letting go**—of attachments, fears, and control—while remaining anchored in a state of balance, love, and trust. It’s an expression of inner mastery and spiritual maturity.

# The Riptide Mentality (The “Downward Spiral” [^1] Technique)

> At certain times in your life, there are going to be subtle, hidden, external forces conspiring against you—pulling you further away from your desired destination.
>
> In these moments, your instincts will tell you to fight back against those forces. You’ll breathe faster, push harder, and strain against them.
>
> But these instincts may lead you astray: You may be caught in a riptide—and in a riptide, the best course of action is the opposite of what your instincts tell you.
>
> In these moments, when you feel the currents are too strong to resist, allow yourself the freedom to relax and let it take you.
>
> Once it inevitably dissipates, you will have the energy and fortitude to safely navigate to your destination.
>
> _**Perhaps the best course of action is to conserve energy now and deploy it more effectively later.**_

> _“What you resist, persists.” — Carl Jung_

Resistance amplifies [negative emotions](What%20to%20do%20when%20you%20have%20negative%20thoughts%20or%20emotions.md). [Acceptance](Acceptance%20and%20Commitment%20Therapy.md) diffuses them. It’s like quicksand: The more you fight, the deeper you sink. Observing the struggle [without judgment](Dispel%20your%20narratives.md) creates mental space for solutions to emerge [naturally](wu-wei.md).

> _“Muddy water is best cleared by leaving it alone.” — Alan Watts_

* At its heart, the quote speaks to the idea of **[non-interference](wu-wei.md)** and **patience**. When water is muddy, stirring it further only makes it worse — more opaque and unsettled. But if you **let it be**, the sediment will naturally settle, and the water will clear on its own.
* Sometimes problems solve themselves if we give them space and time.

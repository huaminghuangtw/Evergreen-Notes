麥芽糊精是一種從「澱粉（多為玉米、小麥、馬鈴薯或米）水解」而來的多醣類，外觀通常為白色粉末，是運動飲料中的主要能量來源。

Maltodextrin is useful for endurance athletes like cyclists, as it is a fast-digesting carbohydrate with a high glycemic index, providing quick energy during prolonged exercise (like long rides) or aiding post-workout glycogen recovery.

Its neutral taste, easy solubility in water, and gentle effect on the stomach make it a common ingredient in sports drinks and [energy gels](how-to-make-your-own-energy-gels.md).

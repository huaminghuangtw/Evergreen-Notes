Turn off overhead lights; use lamps or softer lighting and dim the computer screen.

If you need to get up in the middle of the night (to use the bathroom or check on children, etc.), try using no light or very dim light. Or you could try to use amber or red light (longer wavelengths), as this type of light more minimally impacts melatonin levels.

Bright light exposure of any wave length between the hours of 10 P.M. to 4 A.M. (i.e., within 6 hrs before the [temperature minimum](temperature-minimum.md)) will shift the circadian clock and cause a serious disruption in the dopamine system, such that in subsequent days, you have a disruption of mood.

* We get _rewarded_ for light viewing at the _correct_ times of the circadian cycle

In the evening, dim the lights in your home to signal the body that it’s time to wind down. Use **low-positioned** lights (rather than overhead) and yellow or, even better, deep orange/red lightbulbs, if available; they are less stimulating than typical lights.

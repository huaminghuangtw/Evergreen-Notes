When exercising, follow the [Galpin Equation](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/75u92l72r2c8hko70qqf9/7qh7h8ho6pxeelf9/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1xMzdBUlluUkRHYyZ0PTI5ODlz) as a guideline for the amount of **additional** fluid you should consume

**The Galpin Equation:**

* Body weight (in lbs.) divided by 30 = number of ounces to consume every 15-20 minutes
* Body weight (in kg.) × 2 = number of mL to consume every 15-20 minutes

Filtering Tap Water

Zero-cost option: rest 1-5 gallons of water, uncapped, at room temperature for ~1 day. Sediment will fall to the bottom, so you can pour off the top two-thirds for drinking.

	- _Note_: do not opt for boiling tap water as a filtration method because high heat can actually make contaminants worse.

For most people, it will be **healthier to filter their tap water**. (Brita pitcher filters)

Humans are socially conditioned in nature — we are driven for external and social validation from others.

---

**[Self-Determination Theory (SDT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination_theory)** distinguishes between _intrinsic motivation_ and _extrinsic motivation_. SDT suggests that people have three basic psychological needs that drive motivation and well-being:

1. **Autonomy** – The need to feel in control of one’s own actions and decisions.
2. **Competence** – The need to feel capable and effective in one’s activities.
3. **Relatedness** – The need to feel connected to others and have meaningful relationships.

The theory argues that when the three basic needs are satisfied, people are more likely to be intrinsically motivated.

Your external reality is often a manifestation of your internal reality. Don’t look out, look in.

Focus on the internal scorecard (追求內在成就), not the external/social approval/validation/affirmation/rewards (追求外在成就 [^1])

[Compete](escape-competition-through-authenticity.md) externally and you [compare](comparison-is-the-thief-of-joy.md). Compete internally and you improve.

* **Internal Competitiveness** means you want to get better than your past self. This makes you happy.
* **External Competitiveness** means you want to beat other people. This makes you unhappy.

* Autotelic people (成長心態) [enjoy the journey](journey-over-destination.md) as they work toward a goal.
* Exotelic people (定型心態) only care about reaching the goal, no matter what.

# [David Brooks - Résumé Virtues \& Eulogy Virtues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlLWTeApqIM)

> _So I’ve been thinking about the difference between the résumé virtues and the eulogy virtues. The résumé virtues are the ones you put on your résumé, which are the skills you bring to the marketplace. The eulogy virtues are the ones that get mentioned in the eulogy, which are deeper: who are you, in your depth, what is the nature of your relationships, are you bold, loving, dependable, consistency? And most of us, including me, would say that the eulogy virtues are the more important of the virtues. But at least in my case, are they the ones that I think about the most? And the answer is no._

Humans are socially conditioned in nature — we are driven for external and social validation from others.

# [3 facets that help intrinsic motivation and drive us:](https://sketchplanations.com/autonomy-mastery-purpose)

[@pinkDriveSurprisingTruth2011]

1. **Autonomy**: being in control and able to guide both what we do and how we do it
2. **Mastery**: our desire to continually be improving and learning and bettering ourselves
3. **Purpose**: working towards something we think is worthwhile. Having a [North Star](why-we-exist.md) to aim for and a reason it’s worth doing what we’re doing.

**[Self-Determination Theory (SDT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination_theory)** distinguishes between _intrinsic motivation_ and _extrinsic motivation_. SDT suggests that people have three basic psychological needs that drive motivation and well-being:

1. **Autonomy** — The need to feel in control of one’s own actions and decisions.
2. **Competence** — The need to feel capable and effective in one’s activities.
3. **Relatedness** — The need to feel connected to others and have meaningful relationships.

The theory argues that when the three basic needs are satisfied, people are more likely to be intrinsically motivated.

Your external reality is often a manifestation of your internal reality. Don’t look out, look in.

Focus on the [Inner Scorecard](https://fs.blog/the-inner-scorecard), not the external/social approval/validation/affirmation/rewards (追求外在成就 [^1])

[Compete](escape-competition-through-authenticity.md) externally and you [compare](comparison-is-the-thief-of-joy.md). Compete internally and you improve.

* **Internal Competitiveness** means you want to get better than your past self. This makes you happy.
* **External Competitiveness** means you want to beat other people. This makes you unhappy.

# Autotelic Personality \& Exotelic Personality

* Autotelic people (成長心態) [enjoy the journey](journey-over-destination.md) as they work toward a goal.
* Exotelic people (定型心態) only care about reaching the goal, no matter what.

# [Good Questions](how-to-ask-good-and-right-questions.md)

* _Would you rather be the world’s greatest lover, but have everyone think you’re the world’s worst lover? Or would you rather be the world’s worst lover but have everyone think you’re the world’s greatest lover?_
* _If the world couldn’t see your results, would you rather be thought of as the world’s greatest investor but in reality have the world’s worst record? Or be thought of as the world’s worst investor when you were actually the best?_
* _Would you still be interested in buying/[learning](learning-is-the-single-best-investment-that-you-can-make-for-your-time.md) [^2]/doing this thing if you cannot show it to anyone or tell anyone about it except yourself?_

# [David Brooks - Résumé Virtues \& Eulogy Virtues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlLWTeApqIM)

> _So I’ve been thinking about the difference between the résumé virtues and the eulogy virtues. The résumé virtues are the ones you put on your résumé, which are the skills you bring to the marketplace. The eulogy virtues are the ones that get mentioned in the eulogy, which are deeper: who are you, in your depth, what is the nature of your relationships, are you bold, loving, dependable, consistency? And most of us, including me, would say that the eulogy virtues are the more important of the virtues. But at least in my case, are they the ones that I think about the most? And the answer is no._

In a [scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Do1ALVm9qk&t=1m16s) from the television series _[Yellowstone](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4236770/)_, Travis gives Jimmy a piece of hard-earned advice drawn from years on the rodeo circuit:

> Travis: So why do you do it?
>
> Jimmy: I don’t know, I like the lights, I like the crowd, I like the…they f\*cking like me.
>
> Travis: What about the horses? Do you like them?…
>
> Let me tell you something, Jimmy. To be any good at this game…you gotta do it for the horse.
>
> And where you’re going, a horse is going to be your only f\*cking friend and you two are going to have to figure it the f\*ck out.
>
> And that’s all cowboyin’ is…
>
> **It’s you and a horse, doing a job, trying like hell to not let the other down.**

[The Theory of Constraints](https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Theory+of+Constraints) is a management philosophy first proposed by [Eliyahu Goldratt](https://www.google.com/search?q=Eliyahu+Goldratt) in his 1984 book, _The Goal_.

The key idea is that every system has at least one constraint that restricts its ability to grow or meaningfully improve its desired output.

In other words, there is a bottleneck that prevents the system from improving.

By focusing attention on **improving the constraint—eliminating the bottleneck**—you can dramatically improve the performance of the entire [system](systems-thinking.md).

1. Identify the system’s bottlenecks. (找出瓶頸)
2. Decide how to exploit the bottlenecks. (善用瓶頸)
3. Subordinate everything else to the above decision. (遷就瓶頸)
4. Elevate the system’s bottlenecks. (提升瓶頸)
5. If, in a previous step, a bottleneck has been broken go back to step 1. (持續改善)
	1. 什麼要改變？（What to change?）
	2. 要改變成什麼？（What to change to?）
	3. 如何造成改變？（How to cause the change?）

WHAT IS RAW HONEY?

* Honey that hasn’t been filtered, pasteurized (巴氏消毒), or processed.

WHY RAW HONEY?

* The pasteurizing process damages the honey and removes many of the natural flavors, nutrients and antioxidants that are found naturally in honey. Then processed honey is fine-filtered to remove any small particles of pollen, beeswax, bee glue and other nutrients.
* The main reason manufacturers use this damaging process is to make the honey look nice and clear on the shelves and to keep it in its runny, easily squeezable state.
* The downside to raw honey is that it will crystallize quite quickly. This is a small price to pay for a far superior product.

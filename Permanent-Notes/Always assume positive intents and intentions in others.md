API (Assuming Positive Intent)

---

永遠不要預設別人是惡意的

---

When assessing someone’s actions, we shouldn’t assume that they acted out of a desire to cause harm _if there’s a reasonable alternative explanation—different beliefs, lack of intelligence, incompetence, or [ignorance](have-the-courage-to-do-the-right-things.md)_.

---

When lacking all the facts, assume the best in others.

---

Imagine you’re walking along a road and see a dog growling and barking furiously. “What a mean and vicious dog!” you think. But as you get closer, you notice its leg is caught in a trap, torn and bleeding. In an instant, your anger turns to compassion, and all you want is to help.

---

Try to interpret whatever people do in the most generous way. See if you feel better as a result.

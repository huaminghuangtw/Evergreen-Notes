# The Rule of One Hundred

# Anything above zero [compounds](the-compounding-effect.md) positively

* One doesn’t seem like much, but it’s something real. At zero, you’re still dreaming.

# Don’t Underestimate the Power of 5 Good Minutes

* You’re always 5 good minutes away from feeling better.
	* 5 minutes of exercise—your energy shifts. 
	* 5 minutes of writing—your mind clears. 
	* 5 minutes of reading—your perspective changes. 
	* 5 minutes of breathwork—your body resets. 
	* 5 minutes of conversation—your mood improves.
* Whenever the day feels overwhelming and tough, try to ask yourself: _What’s the best way I can spend my next 5 minutes?_

# The Minimal Viable Action (Micro Action)

* If you’re having trouble sticking to a new [habit](be-a-habit-and-routine-machine.md) , try a miniature (2-minute) version until it becomes automatic.
* Take tiny baby steps. _Do less than you’re capable of, but do it more consistently than you have before._

# A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step

* Running one mile has more in common with running a marathon than sitting at home.
* Investing $100 has more in common with being a millionaire than being broke.
* Writing one sentence has more in common with writing a book than never writing one.

Every race starts with one step. Every fortune starts with a small deposit. Every book begins as one sentence.

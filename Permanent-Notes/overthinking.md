The primary cause of unhappiness is never the situation but your thoughts about it.

人最大的限制是自己的想像力 — 折磨我們的恐懼，通常都是來自對於事情的「想像」，而不是事情「本身」；很多時候，我們只是被自己的一些想法「綑綁」住而已。

* We often worry a lot in the head throughout our life time, but most of the things that we internally panic about never actually happened.
* Usually our fears/worries are based on “_what might happen_”, not “_what is actually happening right now_”
	* Try to remind yourself: “_I am safe right now._”

**You don’t have a thinking problem—you have an [action](cultivate-a-strong-bias-towards-action.md)/[skill](https://avthar.com/blog/growth-mindset) problem:** _Overthinking_ breeds _indecision_, leading to _inaction/underact_. Accept the consequences, stay true to your values, and move forward.

# The Poison Arrow Principle

Imagine someone is struck by a poisoned arrow. A doctor is called to remove the arrow, but the man stops him. “Not so fast! Before you remove it, I want to know who shot me. What town or village does he come from? What kind of wood was his bow made from? Was it a crossbow or a longbow?” While he asks the questions, the poison takes hold and he dies.

Like the man in the story, we occasionally get shot with the poisoned arrows of life. But ruminating too much on the nature of those arrows is unlikely to help.

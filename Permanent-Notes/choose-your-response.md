> “How we decide to respond to our fears, that is the person we become.” — Will Smith, [Will](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/91549698)

> “It is the set of the sails, not the direction of the wind that determines which way we will go.” — Jim Rohn

> _“Between (triggering) stimulus and (emotional) response there is a space (gap). In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.” — Viktor E. Frankl_ [^1]

> “When things go wrong, don’t go with them.” — Elvis Presley

> “How people treat you is their [karma](life-is-cyclic.md); how you react is yours.” — Dr. Wayne Dyer

> _“If we are all going to be destroyed by an atomic bomb, let that bomb when it comes find us doing sensible and human things-praying, working, teaching, reading, listening to music, bathing the children, playing tennis, chatting to our friends over a pint and a game of darts—not huddled together like frightened sheep and thinking about bombs. They may break our bodies (a microbe can do that) but they need not dominate our minds.” — C.S. Lewis_ [^2]

> “You may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them.” — Maya Angelou

* It’s not what happens to us that shapes our lives, but how we _choose to_ respond.
* You can’t control the behavior of others, but you can always control how you respond to it.
* You are not the cause of everything that happens to you, but you are responsible for how you respond to everything that happens to you.

# Be effective, not defensive

Most of life’s conflicts come from people _reacting_ to situation rather than _responding_ to it. <mark>Man who cannot control his words cannot control himself.</mark>

* REACTING
	* Person 1: “Why did you do it like that?”
	* Person 2: “_What do you mean? What’s wrong with how l’ve done it?_”
* RESPONDING
	* Person 1: “Why did you do it like that?”
	* Person 2: “_I did it like that because I’ve done it in a similar way before - it’s the most efficient method._”

By reacting to [aggression](anger.md) with aggression we lose the opportunity to spiritually benefit from the experience.

# The Two Arrows

In life, we cannot always control the first arrow. However, the second arrow is our REACTION to the first. The second arrow is always optional.

Most people don’t stop at the first arrow. They fire a second one at themselves.

* The rejection wasn’t enough—they add self-doubt.
* The mistake wasn’t enough—they add self-criticism.
* The failure wasn’t enough—they add shame.

The second arrow is our reaction to the first. It’s the emotional wound we inflict on ourselves.

But here’s the thing: the second arrow is optional.

Regret, guilt, and over-analysis don’t change the past. They only deepen the wound.

The real skill in life _isn’t avoiding pain—it’s refusing to shoot yourself twice_.

**To follow up an error with a foolish reaction is to lose twice.**

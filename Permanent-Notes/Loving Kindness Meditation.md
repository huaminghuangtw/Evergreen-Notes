**Loving Kindness Meditation (LKM)** is a mindfulness practice that focuses on cultivating goodwill, universal friendliness, and wishing well toward oneself and others.

It is rooted in Buddhist traditions and is also known as Metta Bhavana.

The goal is to develop an unselfish, unconditional love for all beings.

# Steps

1. Typically, you repeat phrases such as:
	* May I be happy.
	* May I be healthy.
	* May I be safe.
	* May I live with ease.
2. These wishes are gradually extended to others in a structured manner:
	1. **Yourself:** Begin with [self-compassion](Self-compassion.md) and [kindness](kindness.md).
	2. **Loved Ones:** Extend your wishes to people you care about.
	3. **Neutral People:** Focus on acquaintances or people you feel indifferent about.
	4. **Difficult People:** Foster positive intentions toward those you have conflicts with.
	5. **All Beings:** Finally, extend loving-kindness to everyone and everything universally.

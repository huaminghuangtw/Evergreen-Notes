**Loving Kindness Meditation (LKM)** is a mindfulness practice that focuses on cultivating goodwill, universal friendliness, and wishing well toward oneself and others.

It is rooted in Buddhist traditions and is also known as Metta Bhavana.

The goal is to develop an unselfish, unconditional love for all beings.

# Steps

1. Typically, you repeat phrases such as:
	* May I be happy.
	* May I be healthy.
	* May I be safe.
	* May I live with ease.
2. These wishes are gradually extended to others in a structured manner:
	1. **Yourself:** Begin with [self-compassion](self-compassion.md) and [kindness](kindness.md).
	2. **Loved Ones:** Extend your wishes to people you care about.
	3. **Neutral People:** Focus on acquaintances or people you feel indifferent about.
	4. **Difficult People:** Foster positive intentions toward those you have conflicts with.
	5. **All Beings:** Finally, extend loving-kindness to everyone and everything universally.

# 給予他人的關懷與善意練習

當你吸氣時，想像將朋友與家人的所有不快與痛苦，都匯聚到心輪中央的一顆水晶球。在那裡，他們的痛苦逐漸轉化為平和與喜悅。

當你呼氣時，想像這顆水晶球將平和與喜悅向外放射，如光一般傳遞給你的朋友與家人。

接著，隨著每一次吸氣與呼氣，將這份聚集與放射的範圍逐漸擴展 — 從你所愛的人，擴展到你認識的人、陌生的人，甚至是那些讓你感到困難或不舒服的人。

無論是誰，都包含在這份善意之中。

最後，以一個充滿慈悲的心願，為這次關懷善良練習畫下句點。

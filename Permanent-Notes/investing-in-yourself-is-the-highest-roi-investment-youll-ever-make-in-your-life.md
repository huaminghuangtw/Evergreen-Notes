Getting an extra 2% return on your $100k investment account is $2,000. That same energy deployed into increasing your **earning power** could have a far more dramatic financial impact.

Never think twice about investments in yourself. They pay long-term dividends.

---

投資自己穩賺不賠。

在所有投資標的中，自己是風險最低的一項。

你擁有最完整的內線資訊，因此報酬期望值最高。

最安全的賭注，就是押在自己身上。

押誰都不如押自己。

# Examples

* Books/Courses etc. (Things that make you smarter)
* Mentors (Network)
* Sleep
* Quality healthy&nutritious food
* Physical health (Fitness)
* Mental health (Wellbeing)
* Things that save you time
* Traveling
* Enriching/perspective-altering experiences/inspiration
	* The expense of something special is forgotten quickly. The experience lasts a lifetime.
	* **Memory Dividend:** the continued tail of “payouts” you receive from re-experiencing an experience in the future
	* **Identity Capital:** the base of experiences and traits that make us unique. When you’re young, seek to build identity capital—pursue interesting experiences as much as you can. As you grow, leverage your identity capital to accelerate your career and life.
	* **Nostalgia:** to intentionally have experiences
	* E.g.,
		* Dinner with friends
		* Going to a new coffee shop

Plantar Fasciitis (足底筋膜炎) = 跑者足 (Jogger’s Heel) is the inflammation of the plantar fascia

Strategies to run faster for longer:

1. Start running your easy days easier (below your max aerobic heart rate)
2. Follow the MAF-180 Formula (180 - Age = Max Aerobic Heart Rate)
3. Wear a heart rate monitor and sync to your watch so you can monitor heart rate in real time as you are running
4. Spend ~80% of your runs at or below this zone

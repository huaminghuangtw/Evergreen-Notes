is a special form of [Implementation Intentions](implementation-intentions.md). Rather than pairing a new habit with a particular time and location, you pair it with an old, current habit (the “anchor” [@foggTinyHabitsSmall2020]).

Unlike an implementation intention, which specifically states the time and location for a given behavior, habit stacking implicitly has the time and location built into it.

The habit stacking formula is:

> After/Before \[CURRENT HABIT\], I will \[NEW HABIT\].

You can even combine [temptation bundling](Temptation%20Bundling.md) with habit stacking to create a set of rules to guide your behavior. The habit stacking + temptation bundling formula is:

> 1. After \[CURRENT HABIT\], I will \[HABIT I NEED\].
> 2. After \[HABIT I NEED\], I will \[HABIT I WANT\].

Habit stacking increases the likelihood that you’ll stick with a habit by stacking your new behavior on top of an old one. This process can be repeated to chain numerous habits together, each one acting as the _cue_ for the next.

Finding the right trigger is the key. Habit stacking works best when the cue is highly _specific_ and immediately _actionable_.

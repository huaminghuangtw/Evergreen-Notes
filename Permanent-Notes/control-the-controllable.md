> _“The more we value things outside our control, the less control we have.” ― Epictetus_

> _["People think they can’t change themselves, but they can. People think they can change others, but they can’t." — Naval Ravikant](https://x.com/naval/status/1505645454754672644)_

> _“If we are all going to be destroyed by an atomic bomb, let that bomb when it comes find us doing sensible and human things-praying, working, teaching, reading, listening to music, bathing the children, playing tennis, chatting to our friends over a pint and a game of darts—not huddled together like frightened sheep and thinking about bombs. They may break our bodies (a microbe can do that) but they need not dominate our minds.” — C.S. Lewis_ [^1]

> _“Incredible change happens in your life when you decide to take control of what you do have power over instead of craving control over what you don't.” — Steve Maraboli_

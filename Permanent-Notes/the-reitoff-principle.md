[by Ali Abdaal](https://aliabdaal.com/newsletter/the-reitoff-principle-for-productivity/)

The practice of intentionally abandoning any attempts to be productive for a period of time, rather than feeling guilty for not being productive.

We’re told to value [discipline, self-control, grit](every-single-day-chop-wood-carry-waters.md) and especially if we’re high-achievers, _it’s easy to see [rest](the-most-productive-people-prioritize-intentional-rest.md) as laziness_. If you are in a slump or really don’t want to do a particular task, you can just “_reit the rest of the day off_”

Give yourself full permission to take a break on days when you know you won’t be [productive](Productivity.md). Sometimes, the most energizing thing you can do is to just “write off” the day and _do nothing_ at all. By doing less _today_, you can do more of what matters to you _tomorrow_. :-)

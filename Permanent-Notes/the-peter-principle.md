Employees in hierarchies are steadily promoted for competence—until they reach a level where they’re incompetent.

People are promoted up to the level of peak [_incompetence_](https://sketchplanations.com/the-peter-principle).

Organizations may end up with leaders who are not effective in their roles.

[Productivity](Productivity.md) and morale can suffer when people are not suited to their positions.

# Examples

1. Senior managers at large organizations who excelled in previous roles but struggle with new responsibilities.
2. A top-performing engineer promoted to a management role, but lacking people-management skills.
3. Teachers promoted to administrative positions, but not trained in leadership or policy.

# Countermeasures

* Provide training, mentorship, and support for newly promoted employees.
* Use lateral promotions or dual career ladders (e.g., technical vs. managerial tracks).
* Regularly review fit, not just performance or tenure.

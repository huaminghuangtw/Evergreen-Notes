# View Morning Sunlight

* Get outside within 30–60 minutes of waking up to expose your eyes to direct sunlight (自然光). [^1] [^2] [^3]
	* This typically requires about 10-15 minutes of sunlight on a sunny day, while cloudy days may require 20 minutes or more. [^4]
	* Feel free to use the time outside to exercise (jump rope), walk, eat a light breakfast or journal in the sunlight.
	* If you wake before sunrise, turn on bright artificial lights until the sun rises. Once it rises, get outside if possible. [^5]
* Try to get morning sunlight before the “circadian dead zone,” which occurs between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.
	* While sunlight exposure during this period has many benefits (e.g., mood, vitamin D and hormone levels), it won’t effectively shift your internal clock.
* Even on overcast days, natural sunlight is usually brighter than artificial lighting.
	* Don’t use screens or indoor lighting as your light source, as they have different spectrums and light profiles for photon energy.
	* If natural sunlight isn’t an option for any reason, consider using very bright artificial lights or a light therapy lamp (ideally 10,000 lux or brighter).
	* One can use a light meter app to detect photon energy in the environment.
* Increases early-day [cortisol](cortisol.md) release

# View Afternoon Sunlight

* While morning sunlight is critical for setting your circadian clock, afternoon sunlight serves as a secondary cue ,[^6] signaling the body to prepare for night.
* Encourages the correct level of melatonin

# Limit Nighttime Light

* After sunset and in the hours before bedtime, opt for **dim, low-positioned** lights, such as table lamps, instead of overhead lights.
	* This low ambient light supports natural melatonin production and makes it easier to fall asleep.



[^1]: Leave the house for a morning walk/getting natural sunlight in the eyes/retinas as soon as possible after waking
[^2]: Trying to do this through a windshield or window won’t work; too many of the relevant wavelengths are filtered out.
[^3]: Contacts and eyeglasses (even those with UV protection) are fine to wear. However, don’t use sunglasses or blue blockers during sunlight-viewing.
[^4]: The particular wavelengths of the sun still come through to trigger positive effects, even if there is cloud cover on overcast days, but you’ll need to increase the time outside to at least 15–20 minutes.
[^5]: If it’s dark when you wake up or if the weather prevents you from going outside, flip on as many bright indoor artificial lights as possible — then get outside as soon as the sun is out.
[^6]: a second “anchor point” in our brain’s circadian clock.

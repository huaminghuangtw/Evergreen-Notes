> _“Start before you're ready. Don't prepare. Begin. Don't think. Act.” ― Steven Pressfield, [Do the Work](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/15554094)_

> _“Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.” — Arthur Ashe_

> _“As you start to walk on the way, the way appears.” — Rumi_

> _“You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.” — Zig Ziglar_

> _[“Whether a decision is good or bad can change based on how you act after the choice is made. **You can't learn all the lessons beforehand.** You learn a lot about what you want in a marriage after getting married. You discover what type of career you enjoy after doing a lot of work. And so it goes in nearly every area of life. In many cases, what you wish you knew ahead of time can only be learned after the decision is made.” — James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/february-13-2025)_

> _[“You can act your way into feeling long before you can feel your way into action. If you wait until you feel like doing something, you will likely never accomplish it.” ― John C. Maxwell, How Successful People Think: Change Your Thinking, Change Your Life](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1158022-you-can-act-your-way-into-feeling-long-before-you)_

開始就不嫌晚，沒有什麼叫太晚。

[The scariest moment is always just before you start.](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/150292-on-writing) Start before you feel ready, avoid _chicken-and-egg_ — a situation where you feel stuck because **you believe you need X to do Y, but also need Y to get X**. Like the classic paradox: _Which came first, the chicken or the egg?_

Don't wait until everything is perfectly prepared or until you feel completely “ready” — because if you do, you might **never start**. You'll get trapped in a loop of “_I need experience to start, but I need to start to get experience._”

# Everything above zero compounds positively

* Running one mile has more in common with running a marathon than sitting at home.
* Investing $100 has more in common with being a millionaire than being broke.
* Writing one sentence has more in common with writing a book than never writing one.

Every race starts with one step. Every fortune starts with a small deposit. Every book begins as one sentence.

Start even if you can only [do a little](Always%20start%20small.md). Once you get started, it is much easier to continue going. [Make that decision to get started.](https://youtu.be/TQMbvJNRpLE)

* Fake it until you make it
* Act as if

> _“Begin now to be what you will be hereafter.” — St. Jerome_

> _“The secret to getting ahead is getting started.” — Mark Twain_

> _“The heaviest weight at the gym is the front door.” — Ed Latimore_ [^1]

* It's easier to steer a moving ship than to put a stationary one into motion.
* [My yoga teacher always starts class with this line: “Congrats. The hardest part is over. You showed up.” I feel like that mindset applies to most other things. Worrying about a task often is far worse than the task itself. Starting is the hardest part.](https://mariandrew.substack.com/p/100-things-i-know)
* The Scandinavians / In Norwegian, they have a phrase dørstokmilla ([The Doorstep Mile](https://sketchplanations.com/the-doorstep-mile))
	* Meaning that the first mile away from your front door is the hardest of all.
	* It is the psychological threshold that we have to get over in order to go outside, to leave the comfort of the house behind, and set foot into nature.
* The Latin proverb “Initium est dimidium facti” [^2] reminds us of the importance of simply beginning a task. It translates to: “_Once you've started, you're halfway there._” [^3]

Work has a sort of _[activation energy](why-its-so-hard-to-just-do-the-work.md)_, both per day and per project. It's just about matching the required [activation energy](why-its-so-hard-to-just-do-the-work.md)—overcoming that initial hurdle.

* [“The Physics of Productivity” by James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/physics-productivity)
* [@abdaalFeelGoodProductivityHow2024]
	* **Newton's First Law of Motion**, often called **the law of inertia** :[^4] '_An object at rest stays at rest, while an object in motion stays in motion, unless acted on by an external imbalanced force._' In other words, if an object is still, it will remain still; if an object is moving, it will continue moving, unless another force (like gravity, or air resistance) prevents it from doing so.
	* As Newton recognized, it takes way more energy to get started than it does to keep going. When you're doing nothing, it's easy to carry on doing nothing. And when you're working, it's much easier to carry on working. When you feel like you've tried everything to properly motivate yourself but you're still procrastinating, you need one final boost to get started.
	* I like to think of the principle of inertia as a literal hump on a road. Imagine you're about to cycle down a hill. You've got your helmet on, your gears are well oiled, and you're itching to get started. There's just one problem. You need to cycle uphill a little before you get to the long slope down. It's going to take a burst of energy to get over the hump, and exerting that energy might not be the most pleasant thing in the world. But once you've overcome it, you'll be cycling down-hill, the wind in your hair, feeling better than ever and gliding on home.

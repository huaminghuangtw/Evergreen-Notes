 [A reminder to look before we leap; to understand before we act.](https://fs.blog/chestertons-fence/)

* [Never remove/tear down a fence until you know why it was there/built in the first place.](https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/chestertons-fence-the-importance-of-the-origin)
* [Never take a fence down unless you know why it was put up.](https://sketchplanations.com/chestertons-fence)
* Never criticize something before understanding why it exists in its current form.

Before you tear down the fence, make sure you know the wolves it was keeping at bay.

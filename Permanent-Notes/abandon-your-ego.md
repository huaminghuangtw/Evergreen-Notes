面子是這個世界上最不值錢的東西。

* 有人為了愛面子，不願意與他人學習請教，失去了成長的機會。
* 有人為了愛面子，不願意與他人應對互動，失去了良好的人緣。
* 有人為了愛面子，把錢花在奢侈的物質上，失去了用錢的效率。

One of the great mistakes in life is suffering for years because you didn't want to feel foolish for five minutes.

* You don't want to apologize, so you let a relationship deteriorate.
* You're scared of the sting of rejection, so you don't ask for what you want.
* You fear people will say your idea is dumb, so you never start the business.

# [“Keep Your Identity Small” by Paul Graham](https://paulgraham.com/identity.html)

> _Politics, like religion, is a topic where there's no threshold of expertise for expressing an opinion. All you need is strong convictions/beliefs, and anyone can have those._

> _I think what religion and politics have in common is that they become part of people's identity, and people can never have a fruitful argument about something that's part of their identity._

> _So it's not politics that's the source of the trouble, but identity. When people say a discussion has degenerated into a religious war, what they really mean is that it has started to be driven mostly by people's identities._

> _The more labels you have for yourself, the dumber they make you._

# [“I assume I’m below average” by Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/below-average)

> _Now I just assume I'm below average._

> _It serves me well. I listen more. I ask a lot of questions. I've stopped thinking others are stupid. I assume most people are smarter than me._

> _To assume you're below average is to admit you're still learning. You focus on what you need to improve, not your past accomplishments._

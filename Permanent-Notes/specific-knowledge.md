It is found by pursuing your genuine [curiosity](stay-curious.md) on [multiple skillsets](specialization-is-for-insects.md).

* It’s hard to become the top 1% in any field, but it’s a lot easier to _combine/stack two (or more) skills_ where you’re in the top 25% of each.
* [Diminishing returns](the-law-of-diminishing-returns.md) suggest that you don’t need to excel in every foundational skill; you just need to reach a sufficient level of competence in each one.

The person who is having fun has a better chance of winning because they are more likely to stick with it when things get challenging. If it felt like a hassle from the start, you’re likely to quit as soon as things get tough.

* You can’t compete with someone who is having fun.

Beneath anger there’s always [fear](fear.md).

Anger is what fear and pain look like when they show themselves in public.

發火/憤怒/生氣時不講話/決策

* Speak when you’re angry and you’ll make the best speech you’ll ever regret.
* The greatest remedy for anger is delay. When you are angry, try your best to go to sleep, it keeps you away from speaking and thinking.

沈默是反擊無恥的無聲風暴，憤怒是抗擊外辱的有效自殘。

[Anger is a cover of pain. When our boundaries are crossed, it’s more effective to express our pain rather than anger. Anger is a secondary emotion triggered by pain when it exceeds what we can tolerate, signaling a boundary violation. Instead of reacting with anger, we should communicate our feelings non-accusatorily [^3], leading to better understanding and response. For example, saying, “I wanted to talk about a boundary that was crossed and how it made me feel. If you’re open to it, I’d appreciate a different approach in the future.” This approach fosters openness and avoids defensiveness.](https://tim.blog/2023/03/01/matt-mochary/)

# The story of the Buddha and the Angry Man

> One day, the Buddha was walking through a village when a young man approached and began yelling at him.
>
> “You are a fake! How can you claim to have wisdom to teach others? You know nothing!”
>
> The Buddha paused and smiled at the young man, which further angered him.
>
> “What do you have to say to me? I attack you and you just smile?”
>
> The Buddha replied: “If you buy a gift for someone and that person doesn’t accept it, to whom does the gift belong?”
>
> The young man, agitated, replied that the gift would still belong to him, because he was the one who had bought it.
>
> The Buddha nodded: “_The same applies to your anger. If you come to me with anger, but I choose not to accept it, the anger still belongs to you. You are the only one who is moved by it._”

[^1]: Forgive and forget. Not for them, but for you.

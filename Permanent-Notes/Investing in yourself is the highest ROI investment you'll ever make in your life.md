S&P 500 → S&ME

Never think twice about investments in yourself (提高自己的身價，因為賺錢的能力增加) → They pay long-term dividends (投資自己穩賺不賠)

Examples

* Books/Courses etc. (Things that make you smarter)
* Mentors (Network)
* Sleep
* Quality healthy&nutritious food
* Physical health (Fitness)
* Mental health (Wellbeing)
* Things that save you time
* Traveling
* Enriching/perspective-altering experiences/inspiration
	* The expense of something special is forgotten quickly. The experience lasts a lifetime.
	* **Memory Dividend:** the continued tail of “payouts” you receive from re-experiencing an experience in the future
	* **Identity Capital:** the base of experiences and traits that make us unique. When you're young, seek to build identity capital—pursue interesting experiences as much as you can. As you grow, leverage your identity capital to accelerate your career and life.
	* **Nostalgia:** to intentionally have experiences
	* E.g.,
		* Dinner with friends
		* Going to a new coffee shop

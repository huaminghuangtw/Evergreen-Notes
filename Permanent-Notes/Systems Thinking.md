> _“The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.” — Aristotle_

> _“Thinking in Systems emphasizes finding the goals of the system. As Meadows put it, we discover these goals by asking, “What is the system trying to achieve?” ― Leidy Klotz, [Subtract: The Untapped Science of Less](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/79888731)_

# Think Holistically

* All systems are part of larger systems, and every system is defined by its function in the larger system.
* See the overall picture rather than the individual parts.

# [The Hermeneutic Circle](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+hermeneutic+circle)

The Hermeneutic Circle describes a cyclical process of understanding where one’s comprehension of the whole is informed by their understanding of the parts, and vice versa. It highlights the iterative nature of interpretation, where understanding develops through a back-and-forth movement between the individual components and the overall context. True understanding is **not a linear process but a dynamic interplay of perspectives**.

* Parts and Whole: The core idea is that understanding a text (or any meaningful entity) involves recognizing the relationship between its individual parts and the overall meaning of the whole.
* Cyclical Process: Interpretation is **not a one-time event but a continuous process** of moving between the parts and the whole. As you understand the parts better, your understanding of the whole may change, which in turn can refine your understanding of the parts, and so on.
* Preconceptions: The hermeneutic circle also acknowledges that our interpretations are always influenced by our **prior** knowledge, experiences, and assumptions, which serve as our initial “whole” from which we approach the text. These preconceptions can be challenged and revised as we engage with the text.

We all live in the same world, but all of us are each on our own paths, on our own journey.

# On feeling behind in life

Most of the timelines are [cultural or social norms](https://fs.blog/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/), and they’re just arbitrary nonsense:

* X title by age X
* X salary by age X
* Forbes X Under X

You need to destroy the idea that there’s an expectation to do things by a certain age.

* A 4-year degree attained after 7 years is still a degree.
* A graduation at the age of 50 is still a graduation.
* A Mercedes bought at the age of 65 is still a Mercedes.
* Not being married at 30 but still happy is beautiful.
* Having the first children at 35 is still possible.
* Buying a house after 40 is still great.

You can’t predict when you find your _thing_ in life. You may find it at 20, or it may take until you’re 50+.

[There's no such a fixed path—you create your own.](https://www.instagram.com/sahilbloom/reel/C8EwaGXgEfA/)

Just keep exploring until you find your thing, then go deep and direct all of your energy, attention, and focus towards it.

No matter where you are in life _today_, you’re always one good decision away from being in a better place _tomorrow_—[just focus on the next decision](just-focus-on-the-next-decision.md).

It’s okay to be lost sometimes, but [never compare your timeline to other people's, because it's a pointless comparison](comparison-is-the-thief-of-joy.md). Don’t let anyone rush you with their timelines. Don’t get stuck in a life that isn’t yours. Don’t live a life that isn’t yours. [^1]

[Life is neither a race, nor a competition.](escape-competition-through-authenticity.md) There are no rules to life. Not everything in life has to come together at the exact same time. There is no such thing as “too late” or “falling behind” when it comes to life. You might be [too scared](fear.md), but you are never too late.

Each planet has its own orbit agenda. We spin through life at our own pace—no two paths are exactly the same. [Everyone is on their own clock.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvJmGY0XK_0&ab_channel=SulimanAlsmairat)

In Japan, there are four beautiful trees that all bloom during the spring: Cherry, Plum, Peach, and Apricot. They don’t bloom concurrently. Each tree blooms on its own timeline. It’s own cadence. It’s own order.

The Japanese philosophy of Oubaitori is a manifestation of this natural way: Humans, like trees, bloom on their own timelines. Their journeys and growth are unique to each individual.

日文「桜梅桃李（おうばいとうり）」字面意為櫻、梅、桃、李四種花卉，象徵各自綻放、各具風姿、各自承載天地的安排。人也應當專注於自身的獨特之美，不必追逐他人的影子，只需活出與生俱來的個性與魅力。

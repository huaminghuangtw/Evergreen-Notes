> _“You’re more likely to unlock a big leap in performance by trying differently than by trying harder. You might be able to work 10% harder, but a different approach might work 10x better. Remain focused on the core problem, but explore a new line of attack. Persistence is not just about effort, but also strategy. Don’t merely try harder, try differently.” — James Clear_

> _“You have to [work hard](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/december-26-2024) to discover how to [work smart](work-smart.md). You won’t know the best solutions until you’ve made nearly all the mistakes.” — James Clear_ [^1]

Often, strategy outweighs sheer effort.

Never press the “Try/Grind Harder” button. Instead, build a sustainable _[systems](systems-over-goals.md)_ for achieving _[goals](goal-setting.md)._

# The Law Of Reversed Effort

> _“The harder we try with the conscious will to do something, the less we shall succeed.” — Aldous Huxley_

* A Zen parable:

> A martial arts student approaches his teacher and asks, “How long will it take me to master this craft?”
>
> The teacher replies, “10 years.”
>
> The student, looking impatient, responds, “I want to master it faster than that. I will work harder than anyone else. I will push myself to practice for many hours every single day. I won’t rest until I become a master. How long will it take then?”
>
> The teacher considers this new information, smiles, and answers, “20 years.”

* Examples
	* When you press to try to complete a creative task, you become less creative.
	* When you actively push to try to find the perfect partner, you rarely find that person.
	* When you try to force yourself to fall asleep, you stare at the ceiling awake.
* **Action:** The 85% Rule (Balanced Effort)

# 不必使盡全力，用四分之三的氣力做事就夠了

> [別太認真 = 專注且放鬆。](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0hKmjsnGSs&t=20m25s)

* 用四分之三的氣力完成一件作品或是一件事的成果才是最好的。
* 因為使盡全力完成的東西，只會讓人覺得沉重、緊繃不已，也會散發一股「世故味」。
* 相反的，用四分之三的氣力完成的東西，不但讓人感覺從容，也能給人安心、舒適的印象。

# [“Hard Work → Hard Thinking” by James Clear](https://x.com/JamesClear/status/1382433293686210568)

We need to redefine “[hard work](Work%20hard.md)” to include “[hard thinking.](planning-and-preparation-help-maximize-your-productivity.md)”

* The person who outsmarts you is out working you.
* The person who finds shortcuts is out working you.
* The person with a better strategy is out working you.

Usually, the hardest work is thinking of a better way to do it.

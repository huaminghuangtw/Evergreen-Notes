**The MECE Principle** is a foundational concept in structured thinking, especially in consulting and problem-solving. It stands for “Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive,” ensuring clarity and completeness when organizing information.

= 不重疊＋不遺漏

1. **Mutually Exclusive (彼此互斥)**
	* Information should be grouped into categories so that each category is separate and distinct _without any overlap_.
	* By making categories mutually exclusive, you prevent overlap and ambiguity.
	* Ask: “Is there any overlap between these categories?”
2. **Collectively Exhaustive (完備；相互窮盡)**
	* All categories taken together should deal with all possible options _without leaving any gaps_.
	* By making categories collectively exhaustive, you cover all possibilities, leaving no gaps.
	* Ask: “Is anything missing from my list?”

根據大腦的三大運作要素（慣性）：

1. 因果關係
2. 歸類分組
3. 關聯思考

…發展而來

所有大腦運作，包含思考、記憶和解決問題，都會經過「<mark>分類（Grouping）</mark>」和「<mark>概括（Summarizing）</mark>」兩個過程。

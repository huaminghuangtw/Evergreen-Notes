* Communication is not about saying what we think. Communication is about ensuring others hear what we mean.
* Communication is about what is received, not what is intended.

If there is a gap between what you are saying and what they are hearing, you have to find a new way to say it.

---

Nonverbal communication often plays a crucial role in how well a verbal communication is received.

State the facts and tell the truth. Speak with [integrity](integrity.md)—say exactly what you mean and mean exactly what you say.

> _“If you tell the truth, you don’t have to remember anything.” — Mark Twain_

* If you think something, say something. Don’t expect people to guess your thoughts and feelings. Don’t hold a grudge when people didn’t predict what you wanted them to do. Just tell them.
* People can’t read your mind [^1] / the thoughts in your head, they can only react to your action/word.
* People who use direct/precise/literal sentences ↔ People who use indirect/shadow/implied/figurative sentences
	* [It’s better to be direct about almost everything than to play a game of subtle hints and plausibly deniable nudges.](https://x.com/anuatluru/status/1849840069064159325)

As [Neil Strauss](https://www.neilstrauss.com/) said, “_Unspoken expectations are premeditated resentments._” I say, “_Shared expectations are adaptive gratification._”

> _[“Timing influences communication. Talk about potential mistakes before they happen and people start looking for ways to prevent them. Talk about actual mistakes after they happen and people start looking for reasons to defend their actions. What do we need to be talking about now, so we can learn the lessons before we need them?” — James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/june-5-2025)_

* 3 Steps to avoid “unspoken expectations”
	1. Start with facts and what you expect, specifically (think “painting done” [^2]).
	2. Describe why it’s an expectation or concern.
	3. Ask a question to invite them into the dialogue.

# The Tip Framework

To ensure clear communication, incorporate these three elements at the start of your message \[[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpFmRq5KeJs&t=146)]:

1. **Topic:** Clearly state the subject of the conversation \[[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpFmRq5KeJs&t=157)].
	* Example: Start with a clear and specific topic sentence, such as “I’d like to talk about July sales figures” \[[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpFmRq5KeJs&t=280)].
2. **Intent:** Explain what you want the other person to do with the information \[[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpFmRq5KeJs&t=310)].
	* Example: Clearly state your intent, whether it’s to ask a question, get a decision, or simply vent \[[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpFmRq5KeJs&t=453)].
3. **Point:** Summarize the most important information \[[08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpFmRq5KeJs&t=499)].
	* Example: Deliver the most important information upfront, like “Our project launch is going to be delayed by a month” \[[09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpFmRq5KeJs&t=587)].

## When someone has a problem, ask if they want empathy or a solution

> _“Too often we look for strategies that will shift people out of negative emotion spaces, but that’s not always possible. During difficult times, sometimes we just need to be there for one another.” ― Marc Brackett, [Permission to Feel: The Power of Emotional Intelligence to Achieve Well-Being and Success](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/68114068)_

We often jump into “Mr. Fix It” mode, eager to [offer advice](advice.md) and [solve a problem](Problem%20Solving.md). However, this can create tension because people don’t always want a solution; sometimes, they just want to feel heard and understood. In fact, **most arguments are not really about the argument, so most arguments can’t be won by arguing.**

The next time a friend, partner, or family member comes to you with a problem, resist the urge to immediately offer advice. Instead, take a moment and ask a simple question to clarify what they truly need. You can frame it as:

* _“Do you want to be helped, heard, or hugged?”_
	* [The 3H (Helped, Heard, or Hugged) Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg48Bi9DA54&t=3m40s)
		1. **Practical**: _What is this really about?_ → You offer help.
		2. **Emotional**: _How do we feel?_ → You simply [listen](Active%20Listening.md).
		3. **Social**: _Who are we?_ → You reciprocate [vulnerability](vulnerability.md).
* _“Do you want empathy or do you want a solution?”_

This simple step can prevent misunderstandings and show that you’re there for them in the way they need you to be. People want to feel understood, and sometimes the best support you can offer is just your presence and a listening ear.

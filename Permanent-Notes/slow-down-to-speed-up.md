> _“Slow Dance: Have you ever watched kids, On a merry-go-round? Or listened to the rain, Slapping on the ground? Ever followed a butterfly’s erratic flight? Or gazed at the sun into the fading night? You better slow down. Don’t dance too fast. Time is short. The music won’t last. Do you run through each day, On the fly? When you ask: How are you? Do you hear the reply? When the day is done, do you lie in your bed, With the next hundred chores, Running through your head? You’d better slow down, Don’t dance too fast. Time is short, The music won’t last. Ever told your child we’ll do it tomorrow? And in your haste, Not see his sorrow? Ever lost touch, Let a good friendship die, Cause you never had time, To call and say Hi? You’d better slow down. Don’t dance so fast. Time is short. The music won’t last. When you run so fast to get somewhere, You miss half the fun of getting there. When you worry and hurry through your day, It is like an unopened gift thrown away. Life is not a race. Do take it slower. Hear the music, Before the song is over.” ― Timothy Ferriss, [The 4-Hour Workweek](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1885647)_

> _“Rushing had become so much of a habit that I was amazed at the amount of concentration it took to work slowly on purpose.” ― Thomas M. Sterner, [The Practicing Mind: Developing Focus and Discipline in Your Life Master Any Skill or Challenge by Learning to Love the Process](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/326331)_

> _“The paradox of slowness is that you will find you accomplish the task more quickly and with less effort because you are not wasting energy. Try it and you will see.” ― Thomas M. Sterner, [The Practicing Mind: Bringing Discipline and Focus into Your Life](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/326331)_

“Slow is smooth/steady/precision. Smooth/Steady/Precision is fast.”

---

“Slow and steady wins the race.”

---

If you don’t have time to do it twice, you don’t have time to do it fast.

---

There’s never enough time to do it right but there’s plenty of time to do it over.

果實熟透了，才能採摘。思考沉穩了，才能充分表達。

One step back for two steps forward.

> “No hurry. No pause.”

* Refuse to feel rushed (or in a hurry). Rushing causes errors. Errors cause setbacks. Setbacks cause delays.
	* Rushing sacrifices quality for speed and leaves you rebuilding later.
	* It’s better to climb slowly up the right mountain than fast up the wrong one.
* Remember: You have all the time in the world you give yourself!
* Think about a 45-minute versus 43-minute bike ride (No difference actually…)
* 如同「開車」，讓日常生活中的每一個瞬間都保持在「<mark>[專注，但放鬆柔和](Nonchalant.md)</mark>」的狀態 [^1] [^2]，建立 [心流狀態](flow-state.md) 中，那種如行雲流水般的節奏感。

Move slow to move fast.

* Wanna go fast? Try slowing down.
* If you slow down, you’ll speed up.

---

Go slow first.

Start slow, finish fast.

Build a strong foundation.

It takes time to make a base that can hold up what comes next.

The strongest things are built one brick at a time — not in bursts of speed, but in layers of [patience](a-man-who-is-a-master-of-patience-is-master-of-everything-else.md).

In a world obsessed with shortcuts, endurance is a superpower.

Once you’ve done that, that’s when you can go fast.

[^2]: 「[Be Water，My Friend !](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/74693436-be-water-my-friend-the-true-teachings-of-bruce-lee)」，意思是武者不被形式所拘，要像水一樣流動，既柔軟又剛強堅韌；既能適應萬物，又能匯聚為強大的力量。當水被某種障礙物擋住時，它會平靜等待，卻又伺機而動；一旦移開障礙物，就會立刻奔流過去，毫不遲疑。 所以，李小龍說，面對競爭與阻礙，「水，永遠都是放鬆卻做好準備的。」

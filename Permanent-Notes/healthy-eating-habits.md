Eating Better

Your gut is your second brain.

# 現代人的飲食習慣問題: 吃太好 \& 吃太多 (百病叢生的主因)

> 「吃」所造成的問題遠多於「不吃」所造成的問題。

* 一方面營養過剩 [^1]
	* 造成體內毒素累積
	* 高脂肪、高糖分、高鹽分
	* 最好吃的食物通常是最不健康的食物
* 一方面營養不足 [^2]
	* 加工食品和垃圾食物通常會加入無營養價值的人工添加劑，同時剝奪掉其中原有的有益營養成分。[^3]

---

Eat as many minimally processed foods as possible (以原型食物為主)

* Eat food from farms not factories
* The more food you eat that doesn’t have an ingredient list, the healthier you’ll be
* Don’t eat anything your great grandmother wouldn’t recognize as food.

新鮮 (原型/全/真) 食物 [^4] 最佳、冷凍/加工食品次之、罐頭食品最差

* Whole Food v.s Non-whole Food (→ chemicals → inflammation in the body → harmful to our lives)
	* 植化素
	* 膳食纖維

# Eating Patterns

* 生機飲食 (Raw Food Diet 或 [Living Food Diet](https://www.annwigmore.co/living-foods-lifestyle)) 是一種以未經加工或加熱至特定溫度以上的食物為主的飲食方式 (uncooked and unprocessed)。其基本理念是：食物在加熱過程中會失去許多營養成分，尤其是酶、維生素等，因此保持食物的生機能有助於身體健康。這種飲食方式通常強調：
	1. **未加熱或低溫烹飪**：避免將食物加熱到攝氏 50 度以上，因為這樣會破壞食物的酶和營養。[^5]
	2. **有機與天然食材**：提倡食用天然、有機、未經加工的當季、當地食物。
	3. **高纖維和植物基**：生機飲食通常是基於植物的，並且富含纖維和抗氧化劑。
* 全食物蔬食/植物性飲食 (Whole Food Plant-Based Diet = WFPBD)
	* ≈ The Mediterranean Diet or The Pescatarian/Pescetarianism Diet [^6]
	* ≠ The Western Diet or Carnivore
	* [從人類的牙齒也可以看出動植物飲食應有的比例。我們有 32 顆牙，但是跟吃肉有關的只有 4 顆犬齒，4:28，可見上天原來就規畫動物性飲食不該超過 15 %。](https://www.books.com.tw/products/0010786351)
	* Eat a diverse range of plants + fruits (「均衡飲食」)
		* 「護心食物」— Bean (豆類) [^7] + Nuts (堅果) [^8] + Seeds (種子)
	* Tips
		* Build a meal around a salad (Buddha Bowl)
		* Eat fruit for dessert
		* Use meat as a garnish instead of a centerpiece
		* The more vegetable and fruits you include in your meals, the lower the **Energy/Calorie Density** of that meal will be → Fill the stomach and send signals to your brain to tell you to stop eating → You can eat the most quantity for the least amount of calories
			* <https://vibrancenutrition.com/caloric-density-how-to-maximize-satisfaction-and-lose-weight/>
			* <https://www.forksoverknives.com/wellness/the-calorie-density-approach-to-nutrition-and-lifelong-weight-management/>
	* 一天一杯綜合蔬果昔 (Fruit/Green Smoothie)
		* Variations
			* [精力湯](https://www.google.com/search?q=%E7%B2%BE%E5%8A%9B%E6%B9%AF) [^9]
			* [回春水](https://www.google.com/search?q=%E5%9B%9E%E6%98%A5%E6%B0%B4)
		* 榨蔬果汁 → 全蔬果汁/蜜 [^10]
			* 盡量將蔬果的所有可食用部分 (根、莖、葉) 一起「打碎成泥」，以獲取更完整的營養和平時不易吸收到的微量元素。現代飲食習慣常常將最營養的部分 (如果皮、果核、種子) 去除，只留下「果肉」部分。但其實這些部位富含植化素、維生素和酵素，對健康有益。這樣「連皮帶籽」的飲食方式確實有其科學依據，例如:
				* 菠菜根含有較多的鐵質和抗氧化物。
				* 胡蘿蔔皮富含 β- 胡蘿蔔素及其他植化素，削皮會造成營養流失。
				* 蘋果皮含有豐富的膳食纖維與抗氧化劑 (如槲皮素) 。
				* 西瓜白色部分含有瓜胺酸，有助於血管健康。
				* 葡萄皮和籽含有白藜蘆醇和多酚類，有助於抗氧化與保護心血管。
				* 鳳梨芯富含鳳梨酵素，有助於消化與抗發炎。
		* Pro Tips
			* Squeeze a lemon over frozen veggies after heating them. The vitamin C in lemon juice can help…
				1. replenish any lost vitamin C during blanching
				2. make veggies brighter and fresher tasting
			* Frozen Fruits \> Ice + Fresh Fruits
			* [Placing heavier, frozen items on top of lighter ingredients helps weigh them down and gets the blend moving faster. This can also help prevent the blend from stalling.](https://www.vitamix.com/us/en_us/learn)
* Paleo(lithic)/Caveman/Stone Age Diet

[@jorgensonAlmanackNavalRavikant2021]

> _“There are a number [of things] on the physical side. We have diets we are not evolved to eat. A correct diet should probably look closer to a paleo diet, mostly eating vegetables with a small amount of meat and berries.”_

- [ ] Identify the difference between **hunger (need)** and **craving (want)** [^11]
* Apple Test: If you are not hungry enough to eat an apple, you aren’t hungry. The apple could be replaced with other healthy snacks.
* Water Test: Drink 500ml of water and stay busy for 20 minutes. If you’re still hungry, go eat. If you forgot about it, you were either just bored or dehydrated.
* I won’t eat anything unless I know I will actually enjoy it.
* I don’t force myself to eat. I will only eat whenever I actually feel hungry.
* If you aren’t hungry, you aren’t hungry.
* Feeling good is better than that “third” slice of pizza.
* Kuchisabishii (口寂しい): When you’re not hungry, but you eat because your mouth is lonely.
* Avoid eating (or drinking) your feelings.
* Stop eating food as drugs. Food is literally just there to fuel your brain and body. Nothing else. Nothing more.
* Food = Fuel: Eat for energy \& vitality, not taste/entertainment.
* 「為吃而活」vs.「為活而吃」→ 你比較偏向哪種態度呢? 你認為美食在人生當中應該佔據多重要的位置?
- [ ] If you think you want a snack, drink a glass of water first.
- [ ] Eat protein with every single meal to increase satiety and build muscle. → 1-1.2g/pound or 2.2g/kg of bodyweight per day.
- [ ] Mindful eating (慢食) trick: putting down the cutlery between bites. Chew properly, swallow, then have your next bite. → Instead of focusing on what my next bite will be, I focus on the food I’m chewing → Chewing your food gives your body time to signal when you’ve had enough.
- [ ] Eating highly-processed junk food will just set you up for eating more highly-processed junk food (「空熱量」讓你越吃越餓、永遠吃不飽)
	* 吃垃圾食物就如同吸毒一樣，使人上癮，並且欲罷不能 → 慢性自殺行為
	* 自問：「為什麼要吃垃圾？為什麼要供給身體低等劣質 の 燃料？為什麼要懲罰、折磨、虐待自己？」
	* Create an environment where it’s hard to eat junk & easy to eat nutritious foods. (眼不見為淨)
- [ ] Eat Less Often
- [ ] Do not eat 4 hours before sleep
* First meal 1 - 2 hrs upon waking (low-carbs \& high-protein)
* Last meal 3 - 5 hrs before sleeping (low-protein \& high-carbs)
	* Your body follows what is called a “diurnal rhythm”. This means that the body is awake during the day and as the sun goes down it prepares for sleep.
	* Digestion takes a ton of energy so making your body digest right before it’s time to sleep can wreck your natural rhythms.
	* This is why we should stop eating at least 3 to 5 hours before going to bed. Be okay with going to bed a bit hungry.
- [ ] It’s better to implement the eating window earlier in the day than later → 省略晚餐比省略早餐好 (Food is more ‘useful’ for the body when consumed in the morning than in the afternoon or evening)
* Why?
	* Early energy/calories/food load/intake can be directly used after these meal moments. An evening meal, on the other hand, will usually be a couple of hours before bed, possibly causing a leftover of energy.
	* Morning food is usually better because throughout the day your body is in more of a catabolic (breaking down) state as you are more active. Also if you body is using energy to digest as you sleep the quality of sleep is less effective.
	* The theory is that your body is engaging in glycogenesis first thing in the morning - it needs to load up on glycogen. And since that is an energy intense process, your body’s metabolism is spending alot of the energy you take in in the morning for that process.
- [ ] Normalize “Bland Diet”
- [ ] 多喝水沒事，沒事多喝水 (Be a sponge)
* Sometimes when you feel hungry, you’re actually thirsty
* Don’t drink your calories. Drink water instead.
* Drink 2000ml of water per day (集中在早上，下午過後只能啜飲)
* Have a cup of water before meals
* When dining out or ordering takeout…
	* Research the menu in advance to make informed decisions. This prevents poor choices caused by hunger or choice paralysis at the restaurant.
	* Choose dishes / Order the food with the highest protein content.
	* Control the portions if healthier options aren’t available. Serve yourself half of what you think you’ll eat, even if it means the plate looks a bit empty.
- [ ] Eat Light: 吃到飽、吃到撐 → 吃到 [八分飽](https://www.google.com/search?q=%E8%85%B9%E5%85%AB%E5%88%86%E7%9B%AE) [^12]、吃到不會餓
* There is a 20-minute delay between eating and when the brain registers “fullness” / satiety. [@rakhaInsightsConstellatingDrivers2022]
* Learn how to better manage/control portion size by using your hands (or a kitchen scale)
	* At least a palm-sized amount of protein (it works best with meat or fish)
	* At least a fist-sized amount of veggies (the more the better)
	* Roughly one cupped-hand portion of complex carbs (potatoes, **brown rice**, **quinoa**, oats, etc.)
		* No white rice
		* 煮完放冰箱隔夜，製造抗性澱粉，吸收速度較慢
	* Roughly one thumb-sized portion of fat (butter, olive oil, nuts, seeds)
* The Rule of Thirds; 1/3 Carbs + 1/3 Protein + 1/3 Fruit or Vegetable
* 211 餐盤 [^13]
	* 2 個拳頭大小: 蔬菜
	* 1 個拳頭大小: 蛋白質
	* 1 個拳頭大小: 碳水化合物
* [Smaller plates help you eat less](https://sketchplanations.com/smaller-plates-help-you-eat-less)
- [ ] Temperance: eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.
- [ ] Protein for sleep quality; Carbs for sleep quantity (避免睡眠中斷)
- [ ] Eat Right: No foods rich in **carbs**, **fat**, and **sugar**
* Intake 150-200g of protein per day → more stable insulin / blood sugar level (more stable mood as well) → less hungry (curb appetite) → eat less → good for gut health because it has time to rest → all the energy that has gone into digestion is going into repairing body tissues and brain → longevity
* Focus on <span style="font-family:SFUIText-Bold;"><b>Eggs</b></span> + <span style="font-family:SFUIText-Bold;"><b>Avocado</b></span> + <span style="font-family:SFUIText-Bold;"><b>Salmon</b></span> + <span style="font-family:SFUIText-Bold;"><b>Tofu</b></span> + <span style="font-family:SFUIText-Bold;"><b>Banana</b></span>
	* Salmon → Beef (> 羊肉 > 雞肉), Shrimp, Scallops
	* _**Surf and turf**_ or _**surf ‘n’ turf**_ is a main course combining seafood and red meat (海陸雙拼)
	* Red meat only causes diabetes if it’s in a bun with a soda and fries
		* 鹿肉 (EN: Venison, DE: Hirsch) is the most nutrient-dense and protein-rich red meat
	* Avoid anything white (to avoid starches)
* The Elimination Diet — stop eating one or more potential problem foods for several weeks
* Fructose
	* Focus on glucose and fructose, mostly glucose, typically at least a two or three to one ratio of glucose to fructose.
	* Fructose is addictive and activates the brain’s reward center, similar to drugs like cocaine, heroin, nicotine, and alcohol. Fructose is completely unnecessary for vertebrate life and there are no biological reactions that require dietary fructose. The human body has a limited capacity to process fructose, similar to metabolizing alcohol. Fructose has no function in the human body and is not needed for a healthy diet.
	* Generally speaking: Fructose → phosphate glycerol → more body fat
	* Fruit is okay because of the fiber, which mitigates the absorption. So when you consume the fructose with fiber, you are feeding your microbiome. The fructose wasn’t for you.
	* The fructose molecule is the same, whether it’s in a berry, banana, or a coca-cola. But fiber concentration: berry > banana > coca-cola
	* Do not eat too much fruit — it’s not the worst thing for your body, but also not the best thing either (because of the fructose)
	* Eating local, seasonal fruit is ideal
	* ❗加工食品裡的「高果糖糖漿 (high-fructose corn syrup)」❗
		* 最好的甜味劑：「黑糖蜜」和「棗糖」
- [ ] Eat zero sugar
* In reality, our body doesn’t even need a spoon of sugar at all
* To avoid insulin resistance, inflammation, and blood sugar swings/fluctuations → stable energy levels with a high baseline throughout the day
	* Sugar/sweeteners can make you hungry
		* Insulin resistance means the cells of the body can no longer sufficiently absorb sugar from the bloodstream
		* As a results, more and more sugar are needed to achieve the same reward effect in the brain
	* [代糖只是安慰劑，你的動脈正因吃糖在發炎｜科學人](https://www.scitw.cc/posts/20250414-18110)
* Salt is sugar

要注意種植方式

- [ ] Food can be cheap, healthy, tasty, and relatively quick to prepare.
- [ ] Food is medicine. (食療)
	* 長期依賴藥物不僅可能引發嚴重的副作用，甚至可能導致新的疾病，陷入惡性循環。然而，許多疾病其實可以透過正確的飲食來調理與改善，使身體自行恢復平衡，逐步減少對藥物的依賴，最終擺脫「藥罐子」的命運。
	* 讓食物成為你的藥物，別讓藥物成為你的食物。
	* _“Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.” — Hippocrates, “Father of Medicine”_ [^14]
- [ ] 1 day of 24+ hrs pure water-only fasting per week for autophagy to occur
* Eating is a stress on your body; The less often you can eat, the healthier you’ll be.
* During fasting, the brain not only sends signals that stimulate the organism to eat; when energy levels are low, neurons also trigger the release of the hormone corticosterone, which causes cells in the liver to recycle cellular waste. It could be that this newly discovered mechanism in the brain contributes to the positive effects of fasting.
	* 斷食期間，腸胃因不必努力負擔平時的消化任務，會開始啟動免疫系統殺菌或修復機制 (這可能是有些人在斷食期間會覺得輕微發炎的原因)
* 復食
	* 第一餐建議以流質為主，例如: 檸檬水、大骨湯，接著逐漸添加軟質食物，像是水煮蛋、蒸蛋、清蒸魚、雞胸肉，最後才恢復成一般固體食物。
		* 不建議吃優格、豆漿、牛奶等豆乳製品，因為它們的結構特性的關係，會需要消耗更多時間和能量來消化，這會對腸胃造成一定程度的壓力
	* 慢慢重啟飲食: 從一些簡單、負擔輕的清淡原型食物開始，讓自己的消化系統重新開機暖身一下，大約過 1 小時後再正常進食一餐，不要立即恢復到正常的熱量攝取量。
- [ ] OMAD (one meal a day)
* Seven meals every week, just dinner → Jack Dorsey
* 每天「少量多次」食用「磨碎/[攪拌](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/791356.The_Blending_Book)」後的「生/冷/溫」食物 🤌
	* Never visit 吃到飽餐廳
	* Never 大吃大喝
- [ ] Instead of mayonnaise-based dips and sauces, opt for yoghurt dips (such as raita) or tomato sauce
- [ ] Instead of opening a snack container and eating directly from it, portion out the desired amount onto a plate. This helps you avoid overeating and stick to your intended serving size.
* Dark Chocolate
	* The recommended daily dose: 1-2 ounces or 30-60g
- [ ] Batch meal prepping once a week
* Batch cooking for a week’s worth of “grab and go” meals
* Eat the same meals for the entire week
- [ ] About Fat \& Oil
* 高溫烹調: 選擇飽和脂肪酸比例高的奶油、豬/牛油 (動物性脂肪，要注意飼養方式，牧草飼養為佳)、椰子油、酪梨油
* 低溫涼拌: 橄欖油
	* Avoid anything under 10 euro/L since it’s unlikely to be decent
* 好油
	* 紫蘇油
	* 苦茶油（茶籽油）
		* 是一種從山茶樹種子中榨取的植物油。它是東亞地區（特別是中國南方、台灣）傳統常用的食用油，具有淡金黃色、氣味清香的特徵。茶籽油的煙點高、穩定性佳，適合炒、煎、拌等各種烹調方式，並因富含單元不飽和脂肪酸（如油酸）、維生素 E 與天然抗氧化物，被視為健康油品之一。在民間還常被用於潤膚、護髮或坐月子料理，是兼具營養與保健價值的天然植物油。
	* 亞麻油 (= Leinöl = Flaxseed Oil)
	* MCT 油
* 壞油
	* 棕櫚油
	* 葵花油
	* 菜籽油
	* 大豆花生油
* No seed oil!!! (盡量減少品質不好的精煉植物油)
* Myths
	* 飽和油脂 (低溫下會凝固) 是好的
	* 低脂不一定健康
* 建議從堅果 or 酪梨 [^15] 直接攝取油脂 (最少加工程序)
	* The recommended daily intake of nuts: ~30 grams (ca. one handful)
* 進食順序：
	1. 先吃蔬菜（纖維）
	2. 再吃蛋白質與脂肪
	3. 最後才吃碳水化合物/澱粉

	> This regulates your blood sugar \& insulin levels

- [ ] 吃飯前喝 (稀釋) 醋，並使用「玻璃/不銹鋼吸管」，以免長期下來腐蝕牙齒
	- [ ] 巴薩米克醋 (Balsamic Vinegar / Aceto Balsamico)
	- [ ] 蘋果酒醋 (Apple Cider Vinegar)
- [ ] 多吃發酵 or 鹽漬 or 醃製食物 (Fermented Foods)
* 韓國泡菜 Kimchi
* 德國酸菜 Sauerkraut
* 優格
* 醃黃瓜
* 味噌

希臘優格 (SKYR, ≠ 希臘式優格) 製作的過程中需要「過濾」和「濃縮」，增加製作成本，但營養價值高比希臘式優格高出許多

魚子醬 (Caviar/Roe)

* 鮭魚卵

Eat lower-carb lunch. Eat high-starchy carb dinner.

# 關於蕃茄的營養吸收和烹飪方式

* 生食蕃茄：維他命 C 含量較高
* 烹煮蕃茄：有助於釋放茄紅素。茄紅素是脂溶性的，能在油脂中更好地溶解和吸收。因此，加入少許油脂，會讓茄紅素釋放更多，增強抗氧化效果。

“**[Limbo–Titrate–Quality](https://www.google.com/search?q=Limbo-Titrate-Quality)**” is a three-part dietary intervention strategy, popularized by the **DIETFITS [^16] study** [@stantonDIETFITSStudyDiet2017], designed to help individuals discover a **sustainable healthy diet** rather than chase specific macronutrient targets. **Limbo** involves temporarily reducing fats or carbohydrates to very low levels (e.g., 20 g/day) during the initial phase. **Titrate** refers to gradually increasing fat or carbohydrate intake to identify a comfortable, maintainable level. **Quality** emphasizes prioritizing **nutrient-dense whole foods** while minimizing processed items, added sugars, and refined grains throughout both phases.

Ultimately, the **Limbo–Titrate–Quality** approach is intended to be a **lifelong, adaptable framework** for healthy eating.

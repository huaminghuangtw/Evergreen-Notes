> _“Our culture has become hooked on the quick-fix, the life hack, efficiency. Everyone is on the hunt for that simple action algorithm that nets maximum profit with the least amount of effort. There's no denying this attitude may get you some of the trappings of success, if you're lucky, but it will not lead to a calloused mind or self-mastery.

Because passion and obsession, even talent, are only useful tools if you have the work ethic to back them up.” — [@gogginsCantHurtMe2018]_

> _“I learned that by constantly doing things that are hard and making myself uncomfortable, I improve my ability to handle obstacles. I get comfortable being uncomfortable—and that's real mental toughness.” ― Jesse Itzler, [Living with a SEAL: 31 Days Training with the Toughest Man on the Planet](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/44751808)_

> _“We must all suffer from one of two pains: the pain of [discipline](discipline-equals-freedom.md) or the pain of regret. The difference is [discipline](discipline-equals-freedom.md) weighs ounces while regret weighs tons.” — Jim Rohn_

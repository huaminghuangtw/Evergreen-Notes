Afternoon Boost: To deal with “post-lunch dip/slump”

**Napping** is meant to provide a temporary recharge to your body battery, whereas **sleeping** provides a complete reset.

# Best Nap Timing

* **Early Afternoon (1–3 PM)** — Taking a nap when adenosine levels are naturally high during the day
	* By this time, [adenosine](adenosine.md) has built up enough since waking, so a short nap can reduce sleep pressure without interfering too much with nighttime sleep.
	* Also aligns with the **circadian dip** in alertness (7–8 hours after waking), making it easier to fall asleep.
* **Avoid Late Afternoon/Evening Naps (after ~4–5 PM)**
	* A nap too late can reduce adenosine too close to bedtime, delaying nighttime sleep schedule and reducing sleep quality at night.

# Ideal Nap Duration

* **10–20 minutes** → Light sleep, quick adenosine clearance, no grogginess.
* **~90 minutes** → Full sleep cycle, can be helpful if sleep-deprived, but can interfere with nighttime sleep if too late in the day.
* 不要超過 30 分鐘：一個完整的睡眠週期大約為 90–110 分鐘。所以當午睡超過 30 分鐘後，人體會進入深眠期，在這個時候醒來，反而會全身無力。

# [Nappuccino / Coffee Nap / Stimulant Nap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_nap#Stimulant_nap)

[Drinking coffee immediately before a 20-minute nap—about the time it takes for caffeine to take effect—can leave you feeling significantly more alert afterward than relying on coffee or a nap alone.](https://sketchplanations.com/tiredness-can-kill-take-a-break)

# Tips

* 不要躺在床上睡，但可以躺在沙發或瑜伽墊上睡
* Plan for some extra time to recover from your nap by taking a walk outside after your nap to get some sunshine and regain your full focus and energy.

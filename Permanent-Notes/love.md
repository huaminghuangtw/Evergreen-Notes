> _“Love is the absence of judgment.” — Dalai Lama_

> _“Love does not cause suffering: what causes it is the sense of ownership, which is love’s opposite_.” — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

> _“Love is the only way to grasp another human being in the innermost core of his personality.” — Viktor Frankl_

> _“Love does not claim possession, but gives freedom.” — Rabindranath Tagore_

> _[“Love is the outreach of self toward completion.” — Ralph W. Sockman](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/ralph_w_sockman_113905)_

> _“Love is merely the name for the desire and pursuit of the whole (原本的樣子).” — Aristophanes_

> _[“Love consists in this, that two solitudes protect and touch and greet each other.” — Rainer Maria Rilke](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/rainer_maria_rilke_164598)_

> _“You don’t love because: you love despite; not for the virtues, but despite the faults.” — William Faulkner_

> _“I have learned not to worry about love; but to honor its coming with all my heart.” — Alice Walker_

> _[“Don’t spoil me with your lies, love me with your truth.” — T.F. Hodge, From Within I Rise: Spiritual Triumph over Death and Conscious Encounters With the Divine Presence](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/461259-don-t-spoil-me-with-your-lies-love-me-with-your)_

> _[“I choose to love you in silence… For in silence I find no rejection, I choose to love you in loneliness… For in loneliness no one owns you but me, I choose to adore you from a distance… For distance will shield me from pain, I choose to kiss you in the wind… For the wind is gentler than my lips, I choose to hold you in my dreams… For in my dreams, you have no end.” — Rumi](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/3239983-i-choose-to-love-you-in-silence-for-in-silence)_

> _「這世界上最不缺的就是，隨處可見的漂亮妞，隨處可見的有錢人和隨處泛濫的愛情。卻唯獨缺少了愛情裡，本不該缺失的那份責任感、安全感還有忠誠。一個人有多好，一點都不重要，一個人對你有多好，才重要。在這個放蕩不羈又充滿誘惑的世界裡，如果有一個人能給你安全感和忠誠，為你承擔那份責任，那他—定比這個世界更迷人。」— 楊絳_

> _“The most important aspect of love is not in giving or the receiving: it’s in the being.” — Ram Dass_

> _“When you love someone, you have to offer that person the best you have. The best thing we can offer another person is our true presence (full attention).” — Thích Nhất Hạnh_

> _“It’s enough for me to be sure that you and I exist at this moment.” — Gabriel García Márquez_

> _“I no longer believed in the idea of soul mates, or love at first sight. But I was beginning to believe that a very few times in your life, if you were lucky, you might meet someone who was exactly right for you. Not because he was perfect, or because you were, but because your combined flaws were arranged in a way that allowed two separate beings to hinge together.” — Lisa Kleypas_

> _“People grow when they are loved well. If you want to help others heal, love them without an agenda.” — Mike Mchargue_

> _“Unhealthy love is based on two people trying to escape their problems through their emotions for each other—in other words, they’re using each other as an escape. Healthy love is based on two people acknowledging and addressing their own problems with each other’s support.” ― Mark Manson, [The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/48297245)_

> _[“He’s not perfect. You aren’t either, and the two of you will never be perfect. But if he can make you laugh at least once, causes you to think twice, and if he admits to being human and making mistakes, hold onto him and give him the most you can. He isn’t going to quote poetry, he’s not thinking about you every moment, but he will give you a part of him that he knows you could break. Don’t hurt him, don’t change him, and don’t expect for more than he can give. Don’t analyze. Smile when he makes you happy, yell when he makes you mad, and miss him when he’s not there. Love hard when there is love to be had. Because perfect guys don’t exist, but there’s always one guy that is perfect for you.” — Bob Marley](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/361858-he-s-not-perfect-you-aren-t-either-and-the-two-of)_

> _“Love doesn’t just sit there, like a stone, it has to be made, like bread; remade all the time, made new.” — Ursula K. Le Guin_

> _“Love is hard. It takes enormous courage to open a wounded heart over and over again to the possibility of love’s bliss. Like Charlie Mack always says, “Scared money can’t make no money.” Love demands bravery, a willingness to risk it all.” But bravery does not mean the absence of fear. Bravery is learning to continue forward even when you’re terrified.” ― Will Smith, [Will](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/91549698)_

> _“The question is, can we love each other unconditionally, or is our love contingent upon the other person acting exactly as we need them to? It’s easy to “love” somebody when they do what you want them to do, exactly how you want them to do it. But how do you behave when they step outside of your picture? How do you treat them when they hurt you? Those are the times that determine whether or not you actually love somebody. Love is hard. It takes enormous courage to open a wounded heart over and over again to the possibility of love’s bliss.” ― Will Smith, [Will](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/91549698)_

# Marry Only For Love!

> _[“Never love anyone who treats you like you’re ordinary.” — Oscar Wilde](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/273844-never-love-anyone-who-treats-you-like-you-re-ordinary)_

* Who you choose as a partner is the most important decision you’ll ever make in your life.
* Choose your husband/wife wisely. This is the person that will be with you on your greatest and worst days. Choose a man/woman that will see you for who you are.
* Don’t marry anyone you can’t _laugh with_ or _dance with_.

---

[Don’t marry someone who doesn’t understand that you need to work, or sees your work as competition for your attention. If you’re ambitious, you need to work; it’s almost like a medical condition; so someone who won’t let you work either doesn’t understand you, or does and doesn’t care.](https://www.paulgraham.com/greatwork.html)

# The Secret To Love: Become What You Seek / Be The Person You Want To Meet

* By Charlie Munger
	* Q: “How do you find a worthy mate?” → A: “Be worthy of a worthy mate.”
	* Q: “How to find a good spouse?” → A: “The best single way is to deserve a good spouse.”
* Attract > Chase

	> _“If you spend your time chasing butterflies, they’ll fly away. But if you spend your time making/mending a beautiful garden, the butterflies will come.” — Mario Quintana_

# Good Chemistry

* _“[A woman/man sitting with a man/woman, suddenly feels very comfortable being a woman/man](https://www.tiktok.com/@therealrabbimanis/video/7281009010029989162)” — [Manis Friedman](https://www.google.com/search?q=Manis+Friedman)_

# A four-pack on love

1. In what ways is it easy for you to show love?
2. In what ways is it hard for you to show love?
3. In what ways is it easy for you to receive love?
4. In what ways is it hard for you to receive love?

---

We waste time looking for the perfect lover, instead of creating the perfect love.

* Love is a verb, not a permanent state of enthusiasm.

---

The best relationship is one in which your love for each other exceeds your need for each other. Find the rare people who fill your cup; who are willing to crawl through the mud with you, to grow with you, and to build with you.

---

Find a partner who believes in you more than you believe in yourself.

---

[Find someone you genuinely enjoy spending time with doing nothing. Life isn't about the glamorous moments—most of long-term relationships are spent just chilling—quietly sitting around and doing nothing.](https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/how-we-spend-our-time)

* A great romantic relationship is not only finding the person you have fun with, but also finding the person you want to be bored with. The beauty of long-term relationships is often hidden in boring, ordinary moments.

---

> 如果你渴望組成一個家庭，尋找那位真心想成為「丈夫/妻子」和「父親/母親」的人，而不是只想擁有「老婆/老公」和「孩子」的人。

* 第一種人是想「扮演某種角色」（身份認同、責任感）
* 第二種人是想「擁有某些東西」（個人慾望）

---

喜歡一朵花，你會摘下它；愛一朵花，你會灌溉它。喜歡是為了得到，愛是為了付出。

---

> _“Love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking.” — Antoine De Saint-Exupéry_

* Is this relationship making me fulfilled or just less lonely? If a relationship isn’t creating feelings of fulfillment, it won’t last.
* Find the people who create your fulfillment, not just reduce your loneliness.

[@chapman5LoveLanguages2014]

1. **Acts of Service:** Proactively make your partner’s life easier. Even a small task like cleaning their room counts. This shows that their concerns are your concerns and that their priorities are your priorities.
2. **Words of Affirmation:** Use acknowledgement and encouragement to help your partner feel more confident about their decisions in life.
3. **Physical Touch:** Provide intimacy in whatever way your partner appreciates it.
4. **Quality Time:** Make dedicated time to be with your partner. This doesn’t mean being together in the same room. It means having one-on-one time to focus on how to help each other grow and continue to love each other.
5. **Receiving Gifts:** For some, receiving gifts signals that you remain top of mind for your partner and that they can’t shake the desire to make you feel good. Gifts can be tangible or intangible, expensive or free.

Trust is a vital ingredient in a successful marriage.

---

Fall deeply. Fail fast. Burn beautifully.

* 「給予對方能夠摧毀自己的力量，但同時相信他們不會這麼做。」

	> _“Love meant jumping off a cliff and trusting that a certain person would be there to catch you at the bottom.” — Jodi Picoult_

* 「真誠地對待自己與對方；不蹉跎於一段註定會失敗的感情；結束時讓它漂漂亮亮地結束。」

世界上最高等級的雙人舞，是兩人關係中的修行。伴侶就像一面最誠實、最透明的鏡子，毫不遮掩地映照出你的情緒、慣性與陰影。透過與對方的互動，我們不斷看見自己，學會理解、包容與成長，最終讓兩個靈魂在磨合中，跳出最真實、最動人的舞步。

# The Prophet (Knopf, 1923)

> Love one another, but make not a bond of love.
> Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.
> Fill each other’s cup but drink not from one cup.
> Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf.
>
> Give your hearts, but not into each other’s keeping.
> For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts.
> And stand together yet not too near together:
> For the pillars of the temple stand apart,
> And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other’s shadow.

Don’t make assumptions about your partner’s feelings — just ask.

[Any time my husband irritated me or annoyed me, which is often, I would think of something positive about him that I admire and appreciate — and there are many! It really, really changed our relationship for the better, which makes both of us happier.](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/small-things-that-people-say-made-them-drastically-happier_l_661426fbe4b02bf8071858dc)

When arguing, the goal is come to a consensus, not to “win.”

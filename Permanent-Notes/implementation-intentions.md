is a self-regulating strategy that you make beforehand about _when_ and _where_ to act. That is, _how_ you intend to implement a particular action.

> I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].

For example:

* **My desired habit**: Exercising daily.
	* **When**: When I wake up in the morning at 07:00 AM.
	* **Where**: In the living room.
	* **How**: Using my mat, and set of dumbbells. The exercise itself will be based on a pre-selection from YouTube.

Implementation Intentions are known to help achieve a [goal](Goal%20Setting.md) or stick to a specific [habit/routine](be-a-habit-and-routine-machine.md)—**simply by writing down a plan that said exactly when and where you intend to** exercise, you are more likely to actually follow through the plan.

However, no days are perfect. When plans fall apart, it’s great to use the “_if–then_” version of this strategy:

> If X happens, then I will do Y.

For example:

* _If_ I eat fast food for lunch, _then_ I’ll stop by the store and buy some vegetables for dinner.
* _If_ I haven’t called my mom back by 7pm, _then_ I won’t turn on the TV until I do.
* _If_ my meeting runs over and I don’t have time to workout this afternoon, _then_ I’ll wake up early tomorrow and run.

The “if–then” strategy gives you a clear plan for overcoming the unexpected stuff, which means it’s less likely that you’ll be swept away by the urgencies of life. You can’t control when little emergencies happen to you, but you don’t have to be a victim of them either.

In [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPeLlMR2D4) of the 2021 movie _[Pig](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11003218/)_, the main character, Rob (played by Nicolas Cage), confronts Chef Field (Derek), who runs an upscale, modern restaurant.

* Rob enters the restaurant asking for his truffled pig [[00:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPeLlMR2D4&t=1)].
* After some confusion, Chef Field recognizes Rob, noting he’s been “off the scene” for many years [[00:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPeLlMR2D4&t=37)]. The chef reveals he once worked for Rob as a prep cook but was fired for overcooking pasta [[01:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPeLlMR2D4&t=64)].
* Rob asks again about his pig, explaining that it was stolen [[01:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPeLlMR2D4&t=87)], [[01:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPeLlMR2D4&t=101)].
* Chef Field tries to dismiss him, talking about his successful business, his investors, and the “concept” of his restaurant, which involves deconstructing local ingredients [[01:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPeLlMR2D4&t=108)], [[02:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPeLlMR2D4&t=158)].
* Rob challenges him, asking if this is the kind of cooking he truly likes [[03:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPeLlMR2D4&t=189)]. He reminds Derek of his old dream to open a traditional English pub [[03:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPeLlMR2D4&t=201)].

> They’re not real; you get that, right? None of it is real. The critics aren’t real. The customers aren’t real. Because _this_ isn’t real. You aren’t real.
>
> Derek, why do you care about these people? They don’t care about you, none of them. They don’t even know you, because you haven’t shown them.
>
> Every day you wake up, and there’ll be less of you. You live your life for them, and they don’t even see you. You don’t even see yourself.
>
> **We don’t get a lot of things to really care about.**

* Rob then deconstructs the chef’s entire restaurant concept, telling him, “None of it is real” [[04:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPeLlMR2D4&t=245)]. He insists that the critics and customers aren’t real because the restaurant itself isn’t an authentic expression of the chef [[04:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPeLlMR2D4&t=257)].
* He tells Derek he is living for people who don’t even see him, and as a result, he doesn’t even see himself [[04:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPeLlMR2D4&t=265)], [[04:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPeLlMR2D4&t=283)].
* Rob concludes with the observation, “We don’t get a lot of things to really care about” [[04:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPeLlMR2D4&t=293)], before asking one last time, “Who has my pig?” [[05:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPeLlMR2D4&t=334)].

# Duality (二重性)

* Refers to the existence of two opposing _yet interconnected_ forces, concepts, or entities. They often complement and depend on each other to exist. [^1]
* Focuses on balance, harmony, and interplay. [^2]
* Examples
	* Light and darkness
	* Life and death
	* Masculine and feminine energies
	* Good and evil
	* Wave-Particle Duality: electrons exhibit properties of both waves and particles in quantum physics

# Polarity (兩極性)

* Refers to the existence of two extremes or opposite ends of a spectrum. Unlike duality, polarity emphasizes the tension or distance between opposites.
* Focuses on extremes, tension, and opposition. [^3]
* Examples
	* Positive and negative charges in electricity
	* North and south poles of a magnet
	* Extreme emotions like love and hate
	* Political or social divides (e.g., liberal vs. conservative)
	* Hot versus cold

Duality often incorporates polarity by recognizing that opposites are interconnected and necessary for balance. For example, light cannot be understood without darkness (duality), yet brightness and dimness exist on a spectrum (polarity).

[^2]: Often work together to create a whole, i.e., one cannot exist without the other.
[^3]: Often represent a continuum or gradient.

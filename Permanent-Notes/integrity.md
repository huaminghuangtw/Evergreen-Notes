From [Edward Packard](https://edwardpackard.com/)’s _[Nine Things I Learned In Ninety Year](https://edwardpackard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Nine-Things-I-Learned-In-Ninety-Years.pdf)￼_

> In her book Self-Constitution: Agency, Identity, and Integrity (2009) Harvard philosopher Christine Korsgaard draws on Kant’s and Aristotle’s philosophy to make a case for self-constitution — **being “consistent, unified, and whole”— having “integrity.”** Korsgaard says that to be good at being a person, **you need to be committed to acting in accord with what Kant called “a universal law,”** for which I would substitute “a virtuous moral framework.” How is that constructed? A strand of thought in philosophy asserts that moral precepts can’t be scientifically established — they are indicia of the ways of thinking of particular cultures or religions. Arrayed against this dismal take on our need for guidance are propositions in the “we hold these truths to be self-evident” category, basic principles like, what causes or tends to cause misery and suffering is bad; what causes or tends to cause joy and happiness is good. **Anger, hatred, envy, jealousy, dishonesty, meanness, vengefulness, cruelty, resentment, and despair are bad; joy, cheerfulness, kindliness, fairness, compassion, and honesty are good.** That’s my moral framework as far as I’ve developed it.

> Professor Korsgaard says, “Your movements have to come from your constitutional rule over yourself. Otherwise, you’ll be ruled by a heap of impulses.” That permeated my consciousness. **If you aren’t self-constituted, if you aren’t unified, if you don’t have integrity, you’ll be a mess.**

# 問心無愧（Be honest）

> 沒有一條道路通向真誠，真誠本身就是道路。

在聖誕假期的一次家族聚會上，一位僧人與親友們圍坐至深夜。氣氛微醺時，他的堂兄把一杯威士忌推到他面前，半開玩笑地問：「要不要來一杯？」

僧人微笑著搖頭：「不了，謝謝。修行中的僧人不飲酒。」

堂兄不以為意，壓低聲音勸道：「沒關係啦，反正也不會有人知道。」

僧人抬起頭，目光平靜而誠懇，輕聲回答：

「**我會知道。**」

# Routines

* 10 分鐘熱身 (飛輪車，非健身車)
* ⭐️ For **squats** \& **deadlifts**, lift heavier weights with low reps (4-6) per set, resting 3-5 mins between sets, 10-12 sets per gym session, 2 gym sessions per week
	* Squats
	* Deadlifts
		* Start with the bar over your mid-foot
		* Drag the bar as close to your shins/thighs as possible
		* Maintain a vertical bar path
		* Lower back remains straight
		* Head remains inline with back and hips
		* Ensure that your hips are positioned between level of head and knees
		* Ensure that the bar is directly under your scapulae
		* Do not jerk the weight off the floor
		* Do not overextend the lockout
		* Pull the slack out of the bar before you lift to create tension in the proper muscles
		* Mindsets
			* “Push the floor away” (like a leg press)
			* “Engage the lats” (like a straight arm pulldown)
* 組間休息時間
	* Drink electrolytes
	* Perform dead hangs
* Do kettlebell swings \& face-pulls after EVERY workout

重質不重量，專注在把「每一下」動作都做到最完美。

Strength 區間只會增加肌肉力量，不會增加肌肉大小！

For cyclists, each gym session is a Leg Day 😂 (Core work is secondary)

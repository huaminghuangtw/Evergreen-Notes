* Types of salt for different purposes
	* Fine/Table salt for cold things or desserts where the salt needs to be dissolved very quickly
	* Kosher salt should be used for seasoning raw ingredients such as uncooked steak
	* Flakey salt should be used as a finishing salt

# Maximizing Flavors

* Adding salt, lemon juice, and oil to cooked vegetables
* Toasting spices before using them
* Always bruising herbs before usage

# Fish

* Use parchment paper for crispy skin fish
* Use wire rack to grill fish
* Use curve fork for skinning fish

# Meat

* Following fat lines when cutting meat
* Saving and collecting excess fat trimmings from meat in the freezer to make custom ground meat or grind them all to make sausages, burgers, or meatballs later
* Cure meat with salt or other spices overnight for juicier results and better flavor → put it on a small sheet tray/pan with a wire rack
	* Season high for maximum surface area coverage
	* Salt throw for concentrated seasoning
* Always temper 靜置 meat (which involves allowing it to come to room temperature) before cooking → prevents it from becoming tough
* Rest meat longer than you think to retain moisture (10-12 minutes)
* Slice steak against (instead of with) the grain

# Tools

* Use disposable or reusable deli containers to store or package food items
	* They are also dishwasher-safe
* Use quarter sheet tray for efficient cooking and cleaning
* Use bench scraper for easy clean up
* Use speed rack for kitchen storage (cutting boards, bus tubs, trash bins, etc.)
* Use a honing rod to keep knives sharp
* Use offset spatula (palette knife) for various tasks
* Use kitchen shears/scissors for cutting vegetables/meat instead of using knives
* Use foodservice film instead of plastic wrap, along with the “cater wrap” technique → if done properly, it should be waterproof
* Use mandolin to slice vegetables evenly

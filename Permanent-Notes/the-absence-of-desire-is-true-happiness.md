# Low Expectations

> “The first rule of a happy life is low expectations. If you have unrealistic expectations you’re going to be miserable your whole life.” — Charlie Munger

It didn’t matter so much whether things were going well. It mattered whether they were going better than expected.

## [Modified Model by Sahil Bloom](https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/are-low-expectations-the-key-to-life)

> The first rule of a happy life is low expectations for things outside your control and high expectations for things within it. If you have high expectations for the world and no expectations for yourself, you’re going to be miserable your whole life.

* Low expectations for things outside your control.
* High expectations for things within your control.

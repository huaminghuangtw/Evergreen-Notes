# What are Lipoproteins?

[Lipoproteins](https://www.google.com/search?q=Lipoproteins) (脂蛋白) are particles in your blood that transport fats (lipids 脂質)—_mainly cholesterol (膽固醇) and triglycerides (三酸甘油酯)_—through your bloodstream.

Because fats don’t dissolve in water, the body packages them into lipoproteins to move them safely and efficiently.

# The “Big Three”

1. **LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein):** Often called “bad” cholesterol. High levels contribute to plaque buildup in arteries (atherosclerosis 動脈粥樣硬化). **Goal:** Keep it low.
2. **HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein):** Often called “good” cholesterol. It carries cholesterol back to the liver to be flushed out. **Goal:** Keep it high.
3. **Lp(a) (Lipoprotein(a)):** A specific, genetically determined type of LDL.
	* _Key Insight:_ It is a strong independent risk factor. High Lp(a) levels significantly increase your likelihood of having a heart attack, a stroke, and aortic stenosis (主動脈瓣狹窄).
	* _Action:_ Test it once. Since it’s <mark>largely genetic, diet/exercise affect it less than standard LDL</mark>, but knowing your level helps determine how aggressively you need to manage other cardiovascular risk factors.
	* Lipid health is tied to metabolic health. Insulin resistance (often caused by high sugar/refined carb intake) tends to raise triglycerides and lower HDL, a dangerous combination.

# Diet

* **Reduce Saturated Fats:** Limit red meat, butter, and full-fat dairy. These directly raise LDL.
* **Eliminate Trans Fats:** Avoid processed foods with “partially hydrogenated oils.”
* **Increase Soluble Fiber:** Oats, beans, lentils, and fruits (like apples/berries) bind to cholesterol in the digestive system and remove it from the body.
* **Prioritize [Unsaturated Fats](saturated-and-unsaturated-fats.md):** Olive oil, avocados, nuts, and fatty fish (omega-3s) improve your lipid profile.

# Lifestyle Levers

* **Zone 2 Cardio:** Regular low-intensity steady-state exercise improves metabolic health and can raise HDL.
* **Resistance Training:** Building muscle helps improve insulin sensitivity, which positively impacts triglyceride levels.
* **Sleep & Stress:** Chronic stress and poor sleep increase cortisol, which can worsen cholesterol levels and inflammation.

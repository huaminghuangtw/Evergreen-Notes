(as an elite athlete)

* Goal: avoid weight gain while eating enough for cycling
* Matching what you eat to your riding
* Eating the right food at the right times (timing your food intake is key)
* Stacking carbohydrates before, during, and after training sessions is recommended
* For endurance athletes, yes--meal timing, especially carbohydrates, is extremely important. For short-duration athletes or sedentary individuals, it’s not a big issue--eat when hungry, not so close to bed that you’re gassy and can’t sleep.
* Eat before training (within 3 hours)
* Eat little, early, and often during training
* Eat straight after training (Anabolic Window)
* To maximize recovery
* To avoid overeating later on in the day
* To support the adaptation process
* To replenish glycogen stores
* 只有在需要長時間 or 長距離 or 高強度訓練前，才吃 High-Carb Diet (Carb Loading for Glycogen Store) → 其餘時間: High-Protein Diet
* Carbon Loading
* An optimal carbohydrate loading prior to a long duration endurance performance is best over the course of three or four days.
* A massive bowl of pasta with a relatively small amount of sauce won’t help. You can only store a limited amount of carbohydrates and if you’ve eaten well throughout the day, you don’t need huge amounts to fill it.
* So you want to gradually increase carbohydrate intake for multiple days rather than just have one big bowl of pasta.
* Do high-intensity training (HIIT) in a fed state (Midday); Do low-intensity training in a fasted state (Early Morning).
* Off-season: do training in fasted state; On-season: do training in fed state
* Train my body to use **fat** as the main fuel source / to burn **fat** efficiently, instead of **carbs** → increase endurance performance
* Drink your calories while training. Don’t drink your calories while not training.
* _Macronutrients are responsible for the drive, while micronutrients take care of the efficiency of the drive._

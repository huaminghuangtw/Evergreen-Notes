> “The scope of people’s ignorance is often invisible to them. This meta-ignorance (or ignorance of ignorance) arises because lack of expertise and knowledge often hides in the realm of the “unknown unknowns” or is disguised by erroneous beliefs and background knowledge that only appear to be sufficient to conclude a right answer.” — David Dunning [^1]

# Facts

* We don’t know what we don’t know.
* We frequently overestimate our own abilities.
* We’re not good at evaluating ourselves accurately.

# Actions

[Be humble.](the-beginner-mindset.md) There are many people of questionable intelligence who believe they are mentally superior to the majority.

* 誇獎的話，出於自己口中，是多麽地乏味！
* 無知的人總覺得自己知道的很重要，逢人便想講給別人聽；但謙虛的人不會輕易炫耀學問。他懂得的很多，卻更明白許多事自己還講不好。

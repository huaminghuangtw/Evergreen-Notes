Adaptability (\& Flexibility) is the single most powerful trait in life—the ability and willingness to pivot quickly and follow new information or evidence.

---

The highest intelligence isn’t knowing—it’s adapting. Knowledge matters, but the ability to learn, unlearn, and change course/direction matters more. <mark>The rigid hold on to what was; the adaptable move with what is and flow toward what will be.</mark>

---

You’ll only go as far as your ability to absorb life’s punches and pivot (軸轉) on the fly.

* Learners are individuals who embrace [lifelong learning](https://hbr.org/2017/02/lifelong-learning-is-good-for-your-health-your-wallet-and-your-social-life), curiosity, and adaptability. They recognize that knowledge is always expanding, and they continuously update their skills and perspectives to keep up with the changes in society, technology, and global trends.
* The learned, on the other hand, refers to those who rely on past knowledge and see themselves as already educated or accomplished. They may become complacent, assuming that their existing expertise is sufficient indefinitely.

[^2]: _[In theory, consistency is about being disciplined, determined, and unwavering. In practice, consistency is about being adaptable. Don’t have much time? Scale it down. Don’t have much energy? Do the easy version. Find different ways to show up depending on the circumstances. Let your habits change shape to meet the demands of the day. Adaptability is the way of consistency.](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/january-23-2025)_

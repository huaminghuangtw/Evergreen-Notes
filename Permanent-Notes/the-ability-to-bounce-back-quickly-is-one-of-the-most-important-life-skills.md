Your goal in life should be to **reduce the amount of time it takes to get out of a bad state**. The ability to [bounce back quickly](resilience.md) is one of life’s most important skills.

[It’s not about how hard you hit. It’s about how hard you can get hit, how much you can take, and keep moving forward.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZUC-uAGLEA)

My wife once told me, <mark>[“When you’re five, you can be mad for a day. When you’re ten, you can be mad for an hour. By the time you’re thirty, you get ten minutes—and then you have to move on.”](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/december-11-2025)</mark>

Life is full of [frustration and disappointment](failing-forward-turns-setbacks-into-stepping-stones.md). Real maturity isn’t eliminating bad moments—it’s shrinking the time they have power over you.

Becoming [less reactive](choose-your-response.md) doesn’t mean nothing bothers you; it means you’ve trained yourself to recognize when you’re in a bad state and pull yourself out of it faster.

		> Picasso was walking through the market one day when a woman approached him.
		> She pulled out a piece of paper and said, “Mr. Picasso, I am a fan of your work. Please, could you do a little drawing for me?”
		> Picasso smiled and quickly drew a small, but beautiful piece of art on the paper. He handed it back to her. “That will be one million dollars.”
		> “But Mr. Picasso,” the woman protested, “It only took you thirty seconds to draw this little masterpiece.”
		> “My good woman,” Picasso smiled, “It took me thirty years to draw that masterpiece in thirty seconds.”

	* Examples: senior management at large organizations
* The Diderot Effect
	* When acquiring a new possession leads to a spiral of consumption that results in the acquisition of even more possessions. In other words, it means that buying something new can cause a chain reaction of buying more and more things because the new item makes one feel like one needs other things to go with it or to keep up with it.

> _“A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.” — Robert A. Heinlein_

# The “generalist first, specialist later” Mindset

> You should explore a range of pursuits early in your career and life, with that _exploration_ leaving you better equipped for the _exploitation_ phase when you go deeper on the arena that provides you with maximum leverage.

Many people call themselves “generalists” as a way to avoid specializing, but what’s far more valuable is to become a <mark>_polymath_—a true generalist with the ability to quickly pick up any specialty, at least to the [80/20 level](the-pareto-principle.md)</mark>, and apply that knowledge to make smarter trade-offs.

# T 型人才（T-shaped person）

* **橫的一橫**：表示這個人懂很多不同領域的東西（廣度），像是通才，可以跟各種人溝通，知道很多事情的大概。
* **一條腿**：表示這個人在某一個領域特別厲害（深度），是專家。

📌 比喻：像是一個會很多東西的老師，但數學特別強，可以幫忙教其他老師數學的那種感覺。

# π 型人才（Π-shaped person）

* **橫的一橫**：還是一樣代表懂很多事情（廣度）。
* **兩條腿**：表示這個人不只在一個領域很厲害，而是在**兩個（以上）不同的領域都有深度的專業**。

📌 比喻：像是一個不只數學很好，還非常會寫程式的老師，兩邊都能深入研究，也能幫大家做跨領域的事情。

| **類型** | **廣度** | **深度**   | **適合做什麼**         |
| ------ | ------ | -------- | ----------------- |
| T 型人才  | ✅      | 一個領域深入   | 合作溝通 + 擅長一件事      |
| Pi 型人才 | ✅      | 兩個領域都很深入 | 跨領域合作、創新、架橋兩領域的問題 |

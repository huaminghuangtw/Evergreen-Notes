[Randomly Intermittent Reward Timing](https://www.google.com/search?q=Randomly+Intermittent+Reward+Timing) is a powerful psychological tool. When rewards are given unpredictably, the behavior that led to the reward is reinforced more strongly than if the reward is given every time.

This principle is at the core of [habit formation](be-a-habit-and-routine-machine.md) and [addiction](addiction-is-not-about-pleasure-its-about-escape.md).

# Applications

- Gamification: Many apps and games use random rewards (loot boxes, badges, surprise bonuses) to increase engagement.
- Casinos and slot machines use this technique to take people’s money.
- [Social media notifications](quit-social-media.md) use this pattern to keep people engaged.
* Parenting & Teaching: Intermittent praise can sometimes be more effective than constant praise, as it encourages children to persist.
* In personal development, you can use this to your advantage: <mark>celebrate your wins, but do not celebrate _every win_.</mark>
	* When you succeed in reaching a milestone, sometimes enjoy that; other times (at random), just keep going. 
	* Even better, associate “winning” with the effort process itself.
	* Over time, you may find that the act of working toward your goals becomes its own reward, reducing the need for constant external incentives/validation.

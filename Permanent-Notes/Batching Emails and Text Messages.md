# Advantages

* 很有效率
* 讓自己有設定目標的期待感 \& 達成目標的成就感

# Emails \& Messages

* 訊息電子郵件不要秒讀秒回，在固定時間批次回覆
	* Just because someone found a way into your email or DMs, doesn't mean you have to respond/reply.
	* [The Assembly Line Approach: wait until it builds up](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/batch-low-intensity-tasks-together/)
* They are meant to be asynchronous.
* 秒回的答案通常不是最佳 (可能帶有情緒, not thoughtful enough)
* Admin Party 🎉 (by Ali Abdaal)
* The “Touch-It-Once” Principle
* 善用 “Schedule message” 的功能
* **[“Make before you manage.”](https://tim.blog/2019/12/18/make-before-you-manage/)**
	* If—as you might argue—that you'll miss out on “important updates,” then I encourage you to consider these two perspectives:
	* First, realize that your emails have been sitting in your inbox for hours. Why can't they wait for one more hour while you work on your priorities?
	* Second, if you're expecting urgent messages, it's time to rethink your communication system. Email isn't for emergencies. Emergencies should come through text or phone calls, not your inbox. Email can—and must—wait until you spend some time on your priorities.

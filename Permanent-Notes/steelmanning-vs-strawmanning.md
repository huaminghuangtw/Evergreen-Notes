Why You Should Build Strong Arguments for Ideas You Disagree With

How to overcome **[the straw man argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man)**? use **the steel/iron man argument**: Instead of going on the attack, we help our opponent to build the _strongest possible version_ of their argument, and then engage with _that_.

Explain what you think your opponent means to them, ask them if they agree this is what they mean, and then argue with that.

1. **Paraphrase their point (and check to see that the agree)** - _So, if I understand you correctly, you’re saying X. Is that right?_
	* Express your opponent’s position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that they respond, “Yes, that’s exactly what I meant — I wish I’d said it that way.”
	* Aim to articulate their position with such clarity and fairness that they acknowledge, “You’ve captured my view better than I could myself.”
2. **Strengthen their point (and ask if they agree)** - _Interesting. You could even take it a bit further and say X._
3. **Only then, engage with the argument** - _That’s a compelling perspective. But, I find myself disagreeing with X. What do you think?_

Remember: The ultimate goal is to [find the truth](seek-for-the-truth.md), not to win. **An argument is when you are trying to decide WHO is right, a discussion is when you are trying to decide WHAT is right.** The best way to argue is to engage with your opponent’s strongest points, not their weakest. You are more effective if you can summarize the best arguments of all major parties in a way that THEY agree with.

A good exercise: write an essay that argued BOTH sides of a point we felt strongly about.

1. Your side
2. The dissenting side

There are two debaters, Alice and Bob. Alice takes the podium, makes her argument. Then Bob takes her place, but before he can present his counter-argument, he must summarize Alice’s argument to her satisfaction — a demonstration of respect and good faith. Only when Alice agrees that Bob has got it right is he permitted to proceed with his own argument — and then, when he’s finished, Alice must summarize it to his satisfaction.

= The Art of Letting Go

---

Your capacity to [say 'No'](if-it-isnt-fuck-yes-then-its-clear-no-thank-you.md) determines your capacity to say 'Yes' to greater things.

---

Logically, to start a _next_ thing, you must quit the _previous_ thing. Quitting one thing is the only way to find the focus to do the next thing.

---

In life, it's not only about the [perseverance](every-single-day-chop-wood-carry-waters.md), but also about knowing exactly when to quit. And quitting quickly allows you to move on to the next thing without incurring years of wasted time. Sometimes, holding on does more harm than letting go.

Quitting isn't just quitting. Quitting is for winners.

* 決定放棄與否的同時，也在決定堅持與否
* 放棄是決定去選其他東西
* 不輸才是贏，少輸也是贏

# The Quitting Framework By Steven Bartlett

* Why are you thinking about quitting something?
	* It is hard
		* Question 1: _Are the rewards worth the hardship/effort? Do you want the prize for winning this game?_
			* Yes
				* Don't quit. Stay and fight. **Because it's a meaningful challenge.**
			* No
				* Just quit. **There is nothing worse in life than doing something that is hard but meaningless.** Quit those things that don't serve you anymore. (停損)
				* 重點不是已經努力了多少，而是明天有沒有未來
	* It sucks
		* Question 2: _Do you believe you could do something to make it not suck?_
			* Yes
				* Go back to Question 1
			* No
				* Quit.
* The biggest risk is doing nothing.
	* 做出選擇: 繼續戰鬥 or 果斷放棄 → ~~原地內耗/迷惘徬徨 or 惶恐~~
		* 例如：
			* 工作問題，一律建議離職
			* 感情問題，一律建議分手
		* Why? 你會問這個問題，代表你正在猶豫、躊躇不前

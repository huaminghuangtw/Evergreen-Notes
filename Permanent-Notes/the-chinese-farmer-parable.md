> 塞翁失馬，焉知非福。

Once upon a time, there was an old Chinese farmer whose only horse ran away. That evening, his neighbors gathered at his door, full of pity. “What terrible luck,” they said. “We’re so sorry—losing your horse is truly unfortunate.”

The farmer simply replied, **“Maybe.”**

The next morning, the runaway horse returned—this time leading seven wild horses behind it. By dusk, the neighbors were back again, buzzing with excitement. “How wonderful!” they exclaimed. “What an incredible stroke of luck! Now you have eight horses!”

The farmer only nodded and said, **“Maybe.”**

On the following day, the farmer’s son attempted to tame one of the wild horses. The horse bucked violently, throwing him to the ground and breaking his leg. The neighbors rushed over once more, shaking their heads. “Oh no, how awful,” they said.

The farmer answered, **“Maybe.”**

The very next day, imperial conscription officers arrived to draft young men into the army. Seeing the son’s broken leg, they deemed him unfit for service and passed him by. By evening, the neighbors returned, relieved and delighted. “What great news!” they said. “Your son is safe!”

And once again, the farmer said, **“Maybe.”**

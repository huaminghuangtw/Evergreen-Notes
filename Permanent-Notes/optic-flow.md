Optic flow is how things seem to move in our view when we or our surroundings are in motion. As we move, the images on our eyes change, helping us sense speed, direction, and space.

Optic flow is fundamental for navigation, balance, and motion perception. It allows us to:

* Judge our own movement and orientation
* Detect obstacles and avoid collisions
* Maintain balance and posture
* Estimate time-to-contact with objects

# Examples

* When walking or driving, stationary objects appear to move outward from a central point (the direction of travel).
* Birds and insects use optic flow to control flight and land safely.
* Virtual reality and robotics use optic flow algorithms for navigation and environment mapping.

# Related Concepts

* Motion parallax
* Visual perception
* Spatial orientation

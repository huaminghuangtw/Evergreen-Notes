> _“Life is a question and how we live it is our answer.” — [@kellerOneThingSurprisingly2013]_

> _“Life is a balance of holding on and letting go.” — Rumi_

> _“There are two ways to live: you can live as if nothing is a miracle; you can live as if everything is a miracle.” — Albert Einstein_

> _“There is no magic pill or shortcuts in life. The only shortcut is doing something the right way the first time so that you don’t waste any time on the shortcuts.” — Arnold Schwarzenegger_

> _“Do not stop thinking of life as an adventure.” — Eleanor Roosevelt_

> _“Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated.” — Confucius_

> _“Live life as though nobody is watching, and express yourself as though everyone is listening.” — Nelson Mandela_

> _[“I think a good formula for a pretty good life at the simplest level is independence plus purpose. You need to have a purpose that is bigger than yourself… and you need to have the independence to make sure you can do it on your own terms rather than chasing somebody else's goal. That's the highest level of psychological well-being, independence and purpose.” — Morgan Housel](https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/morgan-housel-understand-apply-the-psychology-of-money-to-gain-greater-happiness)_

> _“A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play; his labor and his leisure; his mind and his body; his education and his recreation. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing, and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To himself, he always appears to be doing both.” — Lawrence Pearsall Jacks_

> _“A few simple tips for life: feet on the ground, head to the skies, heart open…quiet mind.” — Rasheed Ogunlaru_

> _“Cultivate the merry heart, develop the happiness habit, and life will become a continual feast.” — Norman Vincent Peale_

Most events in life can be categorized in one of two ways: a good time, or a good story.

---

Life is neither a problem to be solved nor a game to be won.

[Life isn't just about where we're going, but how we get there.](Journey%20over%20destination.md)

[Life is not a debate—it's not about winning the argument or being right.](https://tim.blog/2018/08/02/ann-miura-ko/) Winning an argument doesn’t make you right. Someone might win an argument and still be wrong. Being good at debating is not the same as being right.

A good life has a healthy mix of selfish boundaries and unselfish giving.

[A great “Life Hack” is to combine 1) Mirrored Reciprocation (go positive and go first) and 2) Compound Interest (being constant) into one basic approach to living your life: “Go positive and go first, and be constant in doing it.”](https://fs.blog/great-talks/multidisciplinary-approach-thinking-peter-kaufman)

# 七個問答題的人生考卷

[@XiaoYeZhu.YouXieShiZheXieNianWoCaiDongXiaoYeDeRenShengSiKao2012]

1. 你是誰? 你認識自己嗎?
2. 人為何而活? 找到你的信仰了嗎?
3. 誰是你靈魂的主宰? 誰影響你最深?
4. 如何與大自然愉快相處?
5. 你願意與誰同行?
6. 人為什麼痛苦?
7. 如何獲得幸福?

> 下課鈴聲終於響起，我起身繳出了這張寫了很久的考卷。這是一張關於「人生」的考卷，上面有七個問答題。不是是非題，也沒有選擇題，所以我無法預知這次考試的分數。

> 人生不是「是非題」，沒有 [絕對的對錯、是非和黑白](Duality%20versus%20Polarity.md)。人生的許多問題往往是相對的，常常是一體的兩面。人生也不會是「選擇題」，不因爲你每次都作了正確完美的選擇，而有了正確完美的人生。每個人的人生都不盡相同，所以正確的人生其實是不存在的。人生是環環相扣的「問答題」，[…]，只有透過一次又一次的回答，才能撥雲見日，越來越明朗。你越早去面對和思考這些問題，越不會讓自己像一球被弄亂的毛線球，理不出頭緒來，也不會繞了許多冤枉的路，最後被亂了的毛線球綑綁住自己，無法繼續前進。

You always have 3 options/choices in any circumstance/situation in life — that is:

* You can [accept it](Acceptance%20and%20Commitment%20Therapy.md). ([by changing your attitude toward it.](a-true-transformation-begins-with-a-mental-shift.md))
* You can change it.
* You can leave it.

But resisting reality is always the wrong choice / the worst option is sitting around, wishing you would change it but not changing it, or wishing you would leave it but not leaving and not accepting it. This is the struggle that is responsible for most of our misery, [anger](anger.md), and unhappiness.

Life is like a maze. There are two ways to advance your life: [move forward](Just%20getting%20started.md) when you can, or if you can’t, step back and try a new way. The biggest mistake is to stand still.

人生中遇到任何情況，其實只有三種選擇：接受它（改變自己的態度）、改變它，或是離開它。最糟糕的做法，是抗拒現實 — 既不接受、也不改變、也不離開，只停留在抱怨、擔心與掙扎中 — 這就是大部分痛苦的根源。人生就像一座迷宮，能前進時就勇敢前行，走不通時就退一步換條路，但絕不是原地僵住不動。

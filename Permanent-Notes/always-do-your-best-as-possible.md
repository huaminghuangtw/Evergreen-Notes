Blockbuster \& Mastery Mindset

G.O.A.T. = Greatest of All Time ìÉµüêê

---

Be the best in the world (world-class/legend)

---

To be the best at something, you need to enjoy it‚Ä¶

* so much that it feels almost crazy.
* at a near‚Äëpsychopathic level.

---

If you don't try to be the best, you won't even be good.

* It's easier to try to be the best than to try merely to be good.

---

Don't try to be anything, except the best.

---

Try to perform at the highest/most excellent level possible.

---

Be [fanatic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fanatic) about / Get obsessed with being the [greatest/greatness](Do%20great%20work.md).

---

Become so good that no one can ignore you.

---

# Plan-a Thinking

Never settle/compromise for the second best. Having a back-up plan (Plan-B), or even considering one, has been shown to hinder performance and reduce motivation to hit your primary goal.

---

Quality over Quantity. Depth over Width.

[Doing your best means positioning yourself for success. It's about creating the conditions to perform at your best rather than just hoping for the best in the moment.](https://fs.blog/doing-your-best/#:~:text=Doing%20your%20best%20means%20positioning,the%20best%20in%20the%20moment)

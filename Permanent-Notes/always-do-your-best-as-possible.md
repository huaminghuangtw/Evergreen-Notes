Be the best in the world (world-class/legend)

---

To be the best at something, you need to enjoy it…

* so much that it feels almost crazy.
* at a near‑psychopathic level.

---

If you don’t try to be the best, you won’t even be good.

* It’s easier to try to be the best than to try merely to be good.

---

Don’t try to be anything, except the best.

---

Try to perform at the highest/most excellent level possible.

---

Be [fanatic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fanatic) about / Get obsessed with being the [greatest/greatness](Do%20great%20work.md).

---

Become so good that no one can ignore you.

---

# Plan-a Thinking

Never settle/compromise for the second best. Having a back-up plan (Plan-B), or even considering one, has been shown to hinder performance and reduce motivation to hit your primary goal.

---

Quality over Quantity. Depth over Width.

[Doing your best means positioning yourself for success. It's about creating the conditions to perform at your best rather than just hoping for the best in the moment.](https://fs.blog/doing-your-best/#:~:text=Doing%20your%20best%20means%20positioning,the%20best%20in%20the%20moment)

「**[MERAKI](https://www.google.com/search?q=MERAKI)**」是一個來自 **希臘文**（μεράκι, _meráki_）的詞，代表一種做事態度：

> **全心投入、傾注靈魂與熱情去做一件事**。

具體來說，當一個人用「愛、創意與熱忱」完成某件事（無論是工作、料理、寫作或教學）時，就展現了 Meraki 的精神。

> _“When you show yourself to the world and display your talents, you naturally stir all kinds of resentment, envy, and other manifestations of insecurity. You cannot spend your life worrying about the petty feelings of others.” ― Robert Greene, The 48 Laws of Power_

[Average is addictive. It’s applauded by the crowd. You won’t be criticized for staying the same. You’ll be encouraged. When you’re on your journey to growth, some people won’t like it. They’ll criticize your every move because it doesn’t blend in with the crowd. But recognize one truth: This is fundamentally not about you. Your growth, focus, and improvement are exposing something in them: Their insecurities, their fears, their lack of ambition.](https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/the-costs-of-entry-in-life)

[Picture yourself sitting on a plane.](when-in-doubt-zoom-out.md) At 50.000ft there is nothing but blue sky and an endless horizon. Up here there are no limits.

As you are preparing to land, you are crossing 40.000ft and 30.000ft. There is not much difference, but you might notice some shapes below on a clear day. This is the levels of your **visions** and **goals**. Most of it is abstract thoughts.

When you start to clear the clouds at 20.000ft you can start to make out details about the landscape. This is your areas of **focus** and **responsibility** (<mark>Life Pillars</mark>). At 10.000ft you can see houses, roads, and details. This is your **projects** or **outcomes**. The runway is where you, as the captain, have to tackle all of the details.

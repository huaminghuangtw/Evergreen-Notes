≈ Emotion Regulation

---

Emotional strength isn’t about getting rid of difficult feelings — it means you know how to [respond](choose-your-response.md) to them in a healthy way — focus your [attention](attention.md) on the actions that you can take to address your emotion, not the emotion itself. <mark>It’s not about managing your emotions; it’s about managing your **response** to your emotions.</mark>

---

Standing up for yourself without getting emotionally worked up (uptight).

---

The strong person is not the one who can overpower others, but the one who controls themselves in moments of [anger](anger.md).

---

Give yourself a fixed amount of time (~24 hours) to feel frustrated or [angry](anger.md) about the [failure](failing-forward-turns-setbacks-into-stepping-stones.md). During this time, you don’t need to do anything but [sit with the feelings and emotions](acceptance-and-commitment-therapy.md). Allow yourself the grace of that period, but when the time is up, you move forward to study and start to _learn_ from the failure. Don’t inflate the size of the failure in your mind—_most failures are micro details, not macro issues._

Think of your mind as a train station platform. Emotions—anxiety, anger, sadness, etc.—are like trains constantly passing through, each heading to a different destination. [The ideal approach is to stay on the platform when you recognize an emotional train you’d rather not take. You observe it, acknowledge it, but choose not to board.](acceptance-and-commitment-therapy.md)

But often, despite our best efforts, we find ourselves on the train before we even realize it. And that’s okay—we’re human. We get [triggered](choose-your-response.md), we get frustrated. What matters most is [awareness](mastering-yourself-is-superpower.md). First, recognize when you’ve stepped onto the wrong train. Then, practice getting off before it takes you too far. Practice long enough, and the rides will become shorter. Eventually, you’ll develop the ability to stay grounded—mindfully choosing which trains are worth the journey.

# The HALT Method

Before making an important decision ask: “_Am I **hungry**, **angry**, **lonely**, or **tired**?_” If you answer “yes” to any of them, address it before [making any decisions](decision-making.md).

* When your thinking is contaminated by negative emotions, make as few decisions and engage in as few interactions as possible. This keeps these emotions from spilling over into your life and prevents you from making hasty decisions.
* You never regret taking a night to sleep on an emotional response. But you do regret ones done in the moment.
* If you’re about to take an emotion-induced action, take more deep breaths and wait 24 hours.

The thing that prevents you from seeing what’s actually happening are your emotions. Our emotions are constantly clouding our [judgment](judgment-is-the-most-important-skill-in-an-age-of-infinite-leverage.md).

> “Think of life like a play, and it will ease your mind when you’re challenged or when someone stands in your way. Told yourself they were playing a role. **Every story needs a villain.** So why should you waste energy being upset at the villains in your story? Instead, you could use that energy as the fuel to beat them.” — Arnold Schwarzenegger

> “Never wrestle with a pig in the mud because you’ll both get dirty and the pig likes it”. — George Bernard Shaw

> “You cannot control the behavior of others, but you can always choose how you respond to it.” — Roy T. Bennett

> “It is difficult to free fools from the chains they revere.” — Voltaire

> “Talk sense to a fool and he calls you foolish.” — Euripides

> “Never argue with a fool, because from a distance, people can’t tell who’s who.” — Will Smith, [Will](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/91549698)

* 不要和白痴吵架

	> _“Always aspire to act in a way that cancels out someone else’s cruel or stupid behavior.” — Carl Hiaasen_

	* 「逆境菩薩」
	* Love your enemies—not by seeking their approval, but by turning your feelings about them into fuel. Let their doubt drive you. [Be so exceptional at what you do](always-do-your-best-as-possible.md) that they’re forced to respect you, not out of affection, but awe. They don’t need to like you. It’s about earning respect through undeniable excellence, shattering their preconceptions with your relentless work and undeniable results.
* [Reminder: If someone is acting like an idiot, you can just move on and let them be wrong. You do not have a personal obligation to correct people who are committed to being stupid. Sure, sometimes you need to attempt to get on the same page, but usually you can simply reclaim your time and move on to more productive ventures.](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/april-24-2025)
	* Knowing when to stop is a superpower. You don’t need to attend every argument you’re invited to, nor should you [waste your energy](energy-management.md) every time.
	* The more easily you get offended, the less emotional intelligence you have. Invest your emotions wisely. Don’t engage in any fruitless arguments.
	* The worst waste of time is arguing with the fool and fanatic who does not care about truth or reality, but only the victory of his beliefs and illusions.

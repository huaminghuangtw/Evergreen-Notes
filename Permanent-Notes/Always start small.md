# The One Percent Rule

* $1.00^{365} = 1.00$ v.s $1.01^{365} = 37.8$
* “The Mamba Mentality” by Kobe Bryant
	* Try to get 1% better at what your are doing every single day.
* [“Marginal Gains” by Sir David Brailsford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THNBIQenywc)
	* Pay attention to every little detail, and then trying to improve it by 1%, will have massive [compound](The%20Compounding%20Effect.md) benefits when added together in the long run.

Anything above zero [compounds](The%20Compounding%20Effect.md) positively

# Don’t Underestimate The Power Of 5 Good Minutes

* You’re always 5 good minutes away from feeling better.
	* 5 minutes of exercise—your energy shifts. 
	* 5 minutes of writing—your mind clears. 
	* 5 minutes of reading—your perspective changes. 
	* 5 minutes of breathwork—your body resets. 
	* 5 minutes of conversation—your mood improves.
* Whenever the day feels overwhelming and tough, try to ask yourself: _What’s the best way I can spend my next 5 minutes?_

# Small Things Become Big Things

> For want of a nail, the shoe was lost.
> For want of a shoe, the horse was lost.
> For want of a horse, the rider was lost.
> For want of a rider, the battle was lost.
> For want of a battle, the kingdom was lost.
> All for the want of a horseshoe nail.

# The Minimal Viable Action (Micro Action)

* If you’re having trouble sticking to a new [habit](be-a-habit-and-routine-machine.md) , try a miniature (2-minute) version until it becomes automatic.
* Take tiny baby steps. _Do less than you’re capable of, but do it more consistently than you have before._
* [不靠衝勁](Do%20not%20use%20your%20willpower%20unless%20you%20absolutely%20have%20to.md)，靠低門檻 [開始](just-getting-started.md)

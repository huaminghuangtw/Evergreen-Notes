Staying alone is better than staying with the wrong.

To shine in the light, you have to embrace the boredom in the dark.

There are many elements of [living a good life](how-to-live-a-life.md), but the first and most foundational is to [love yourself](self-compassion.md) and enjoy spending time with yourself.

[Go do things on your own / Take yourself on dates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7X7sZzSXYs) so you learn to trust your mind and view it as a welcome companion. If someone declared, “Tomorrow you must spend the day alone” the hope is that you would reply, “That sounds like a good day!”

The person who is at ease within finds every other space larger and more enjoyable. [^1]

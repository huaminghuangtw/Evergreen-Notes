Staying alone is better than staying with the wrong.

To shine in the light, you have to embrace the boredom in the dark.

There are many elements of living a good life, but the first and most foundational is to love yourself and enjoy spending time with yourself.

Go do things on your own so you learn to trust your mind and view it as a welcome companion. If someone declared, “Tomorrow you must spend the day alone” the hope is that you would reply, “That sounds like a good day!”

The person who is at ease within finds every other space larger and more enjoyable. [^1]

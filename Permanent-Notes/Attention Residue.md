Close “Open Loops” (Anything that is pulling your [attention](attention.md), stopping you from reaching states of flow)

Closing with (a sense of) completion

Always finish what you've started. Never start what you can't finish.

> _[Drop a task when it is only partially finished, without any good “closure”; it then either gets lost, or weighs on one’s mind and prevents one from fully thinking about something else, or has to be redone from an earlier point when one picks it up again.](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/08/07/on-time-management/)_

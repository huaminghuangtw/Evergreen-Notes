> _“You will be civilized on the day you can spend a long period doing nothing, learning nothing, and improving nothing, without feeling the slightest amount of guilt.”_

[@hanBurnoutSociety2015]

> _“If sleep represents the high point of bodily relaxation, deep boredom is the peak of mental relaxation.” _

> _[“People who do a job that claims to be creative have to be alone to recharge their batteries. You can’t live 24 hours a day in the spotlight and remain creative. For people like me, solitude is a victory.” — Karl Lagerfeld](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/324395-people-who-do-a-job-that-claims-to-be-creative)_

> _[“If you want to operate at maximum productivity, efficiency, and creativity, you're going to work on things that you're excited about at the moment you're excited about them and accept nothing less. It is better to sit on your butt and do nothing than it is to work on things that you are not excited about.” — Naval Ravikant](https://podclips.com/c/its-better-to-do-nothing-than-work-on-something-youre-not-excited-about)_ [^1]

After observing that highly creative individuals like Einstein, Mozart, and da Vinci valued “free-floating periods of thought,” [@andreasenJourneyChaosCreativity2011] studied brain activity during idle moments.

Surprisingly, the brain wasn’t idle at all but rather engaged in active processes. This state, called **Random Episodic Silent Thinking (R.E.S.T.)** or the **Default Mode Network (DMN) 預設模式網路** [@raichleDefaultModeBrain2001], is when the brain actively seeks connections and forms associations, making sense of experiences.

DMN is best known for being active when a person is not focused on the outside world, engaged with doing mindless activities (such as _walking_, _running_, _bike riding_, _taking shower_ ,[^2] _driving_, _house cleaning_, _washing the dishes_, _hanging up the laundry_, _going to the grocery store_, _sitting on the beach/couch/sofa_, etc.), and the brain is at wakeful rest (such as during daydreaming and mind-wandering [^3]).

# When the brain relaxes sufficiently, creative solutions do appear.

* Our brain is a self-organizing system—default to creativity when it’s in a “wakeful resting state”—free of inputs/free to [wander](wander.md).
* Creativity tends to arise in states of relaxation which are _preceded by a long period of focused deep thinking_.

For Warren Buffett, it’s a much more important practice to take the time for _[doing nothing](wu-wei.md) and just sitting and thinking_ than filling out every minute of his day with tasks.

[Free time](slackness.md) is nuclear fusion for creativity. Free time is a call option on pursuing future interesting/exciting opportunities.

# Boredom Alpha

Your most creative moments come during bouts of boredom. Experiencing [regular periods of boredom](solitude.md) is a competitive advantage. When you’re bored, your mind [wanders](wander.md), and creative insight (洞察力) strikes.

Boredom is a filter. Common ideas come before it. Uncommon ideas come after it. Stay with a project long enough to get bored with it, and then push yourself even further. The most valuable insights often bubble up after you get bored.

JK Rowling came up with the idea for Harry Potter while waiting for a train.

> _“[A few years later in 1990, after moving to London, I was sitting on a delayed train back home from Manchester when suddenly I had the idea of a boy wizard who went to wizarding school. Harry Potter and Hogwarts came out of nowhere in the most physical rush of excitement, and ideas came teeming into my head.](https://stories.jkrowling.com/my-story#:~:text=A%20few%20years%20later%20in%E2%80%AF1990%2C%20after%20moving%20to%20London%2C%20I%20was%20sitting%20on%20a%20delayed%20train%20back%20home%20from%20Manchester%20when%20suddenly%20I%20had%20the%20idea%20of%20a%20boy%20wizard%20who%20went%20to%20wizarding%20school.%20Harry%20Potter%20and%20Hogwarts%20came%20out%20of%20nowhere%20in%20the%20most%20physical%20rush%20of%20excitement%2C%20and%20ideas%20came%20teeming%20into%20my%20head.)”_

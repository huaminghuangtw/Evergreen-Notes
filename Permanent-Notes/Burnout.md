Burnout isn’t just something that happens to overworked people in high-stress, demanding jobs. It also happens:

* when you treat [rest](the-most-productive-people-prioritize-intentional-rest.md) as a _reward_ to be earned rather than a _right_ you deserve.
* when work loses its sense of meaning, joy, or balance.

---

You may feel overwhelmed, unmotivated, and unable to keep up, no matter how hard you try.

According to the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/news/item/28-05-2019-burn-out-an-occupational-phenomenon-international-classification-of-diseases), burn-out is a syndrome conceptualized as resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed. It is characterized by three dimensions:

* feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion;
* increased mental distance from one’s job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one’s job; and
* reduced professional efficacy.

# 通常不是因為工作量太多，而是不知道「為何而戰」。

* [A lot of “burnout” is just the result of prolonged exposure to environments you were never truly aligned with to start. Sometimes burnout is just a late-stage indicator or early-stage misalignment.](https://x.com/anuatluru/status/1773520190543626340)
* Burnout often isn’t about how many hours you work—it’s about how the work makes you _feel_.

* 指身心極度疲憊，接近崩潰但尚未完全過勞的狀態，就像差一步就要烤焦的吐司。
* 看似金黃收香，但其實只差一步就要焦黑？

[Karoshi (過勞死)](https://www.google.com/search?q=Karoshi) is a Japanese term that means **“death from overwork.”** It refers to sudden deaths caused by excessive work-related stress, often due to long hours, heavy workloads, and high-pressure environments. The main causes of Karoshi are typically heart attacks, strokes, and suicide due to extreme overwork.

# Three Types Of Burnout

[@abdaalFeelGoodProductivityHow2024]

1. Overexertion Burnout
	* This burnout comes from doing **too much for too long** [^1] without adequate rest or recovery.
2. Depletion Burnout
	* This burnout arises from **doing work that constantly drains your energy**, even if the workload itself isn’t overwhelming.
3. Misalignment Burnout
	* This occurs when your work is **out of sync with your values, goals, or identity**.

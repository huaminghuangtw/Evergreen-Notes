> _“Any success takes one in a row. Do one thing well, then another. Once, then once more. Over and over until the end, then it’s one in a row again.” — [@mcconaugheyGreenlights2021]_

> _[“At some point, everything's gonna go south on you and you're going to say, this is it. This is how I end. Now you can either accept that, or you can get to work. That's all it is. You just begin. You do the math. You solve one problem and you solve the next one, and then the next. And If you solve enough problems, you get to come home.” — The Martian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDYCLFE86Po)_

# The Bricklayer (Next Play) Mentality

> _["You don't try to build a wall. You don't start by saying, I'm going to build the biggest, baddest wall that's ever been built. You say, I'm going to lay this brick as perfectly as a brick can be laid. You do that every single day, and soon you have a wall." —  Will Smith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIsgyIq_kFs&t=128s)_

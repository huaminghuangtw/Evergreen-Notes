# Steps

1. List 25 goals you want to achieve.
2. Pick the top 5 goals that truly speak to you. Circle them.
3. Cross out the other 20 goals. No matter how important they seem, they are the biggest distractions. Avoid them at all costs.
4. Focus only on your top 5 goals. Put all your energy and focus into them. The rest will only hold you back from reaching your ultimate success.

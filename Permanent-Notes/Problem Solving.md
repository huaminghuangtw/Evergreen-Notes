# Kidlin’s Law

> “If you can write down a problem clearly, you’ve already solved half of it.”

Writing is a powerful tool for problem-solving, because writing is thinking. You cannot write clearly if you aren’t thinking clearly.

It’s less about what you create on the page and more about what the page creates in you.

The clarity you seek is found on the blank page you avoid.

> Writing by hand is thinking on paper.
> Thoughts grow into words, sentences and pictures.
> Memories become stories. Ideas are transformed into projects. Notes inspire insight. We write and understand, learn, see and think - with the hand.

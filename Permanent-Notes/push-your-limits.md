> While walking through an elephant camp, a woman noticed that the elephants were only being secured by a small rope around one ankle.
>
> The huge animals were clearly capable of breaking the rope.
>
> Confused, she asked one of the keepers why the elephants didn’t break the ropes and wander off.
>
> “Well, when the elephants were very young, we used the same small rope, but at that age, it was strong enough to hold them. Now, even though they are much bigger, they still believe the rope can hold them, so they never try to break it.”

> _[“Over the years, I have come to realize that the greatest trap in our life is not success, popularity, or power, but self-rejection. Success, popularity, and power can indeed present a great temptation, but their seductive quality often comes from the way they are part of the much larger temptation to self-rejection. When we have come to believe in the voices that call us worthless and unlovable, then success, popularity, and power are easily perceived as attractive solutions. The real trap, however, is self-rejection. As soon as someone accuses me or criticizes me, as soon as I am rejected, left alone, or abandoned, I find myself thinking, "Well, that proves once again that I am a nobody." … [My dark side says,] I am no good… I deserve to be pushed aside, forgotten, rejected, and abandoned. Self-rejection is the greatest enemy of the spiritual life because it contradicts the sacred voice that calls us the "Beloved." Being the Beloved constitutes the core truth of our existence.” — Henri J.M. Nouwen](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/230436-over-the-years-i-have-come-to-realize-that-the)_

# Two Of The Biggest Impediments To Life Change

* [Emotion](Emotion%20Control.md): We’re all emotional creatures. We’re so close to everything in our own lives that it’s often hard to remove emotions from our decisions.
* [Inaction](cultivate-a-strong-bias-towards-action.md): It’s always easier to maintain the [status quo](the-present-bias.md) than taking action. It’s a constant internal battle with yourself especially when inaction appears to be less risky and painful. Yet, when you examine the worst-case scenario, it isn’t as scary as you imagined. In fact, the greatest risk lies in doing nothing at all—once you embrace taking risks, they become far less intimidating than they first seem.

# 跨越心理制約的框架

* Don’t limit your challenges. Challenge your limits.
* Know your limits but never stop trying to exceed them.
* The only limits in life are…
	* the laws of physics.
	* the ones we create for ourselves.
* Don’t cage yourself. You are capable of much more than you could imagine. You are much more than what you perceive yourself to be. Don’t be the one to tell yourself no.
* Always think big [@schwartzMagicThinkingBig1987]—when you think big and lose, you often grow more than when you think small and win.

Your present circumstances don’t determine where you can go; they merely determine where you start.

# The 40% Rule By David Goggins

[@gogginsCantHurtMe2018]

> _“When you think that you are done, you’re only 40% in to what your body’s capable of doing. That’s just the limits that we put on ourselves.”_

* People typically quit when they are only 40% exhausted; they still have 60% left in the tank.
	* 當你覺得自己已經「撐不下去了」時，其實你只用了自己潛力的 40%，還有 60% 的潛力沒有被挖掘出來。人的極限常常是心理設下的，而不是身體真正的極限。
* When the low fuel light comes on, your tank still holds 10–15% of fuel — enough to keep going for dozens of kilometers. Your brain works the same way: it warns you to stop long before you’re truly empty. Trust that you’ve still got more in the tank.
	* 汽車加油燈的比喻：當汽車的油燈亮起時，很多人會以為「完了，快沒油了，撐不住了」。但實際上，它只是個警告燈；只是在提醒你油量低了—通常是在油箱還剩下 10～15% 燃油時才會亮起，換句話說，你往往還能再開個 50 到 100 公里沒問題。因此，當油燈（心理極限）亮起時，其實你體內還有很多燃料（潛力）沒被發揮。不要一看到「油燈」亮就急著停下來，學會信任自己，其實你還能再前進一段不短的距離。

# 後照鏡症候群 ＝ Rearview Mirror Syndrome (RMS)

> _“Always focus on the front windshield and not the rear view mirror.” — Colin Powell_

* 我們的潛在心理都有一面「自我設限」的後視鏡，透過這面鏡子，我們會下意識地重複依賴並複製我們過去，誤以為過去的我們就是現在的我們。這導致我們一直被過去所侷限，而限制了我們現在真正的潛力 (We mistakenly believe that _who we were is who we are_, thus limiting our true potential in the present)
* 例如，我們想創造更好的人生，卻不知道如何「用不同於過去的方式」去改變它，而不斷地把昨天的恐懼和擔憂帶到今天。最糟糕的是，當機會來臨時，我們立刻檢視後視鏡，用過去的經驗和能力來評估自己，認為「我以前從未做過這種事」、「我還不到那個水平」，所以「我做不到」。
* Action: 「後照鏡思維」(以「過去」為起點) →「倒序推理思維」(以「未來」為起點)

The good path that isn’t yours is much more challenging.

As you move outside of your comfort zone, what was once the unknown and frightening becomes your new normal. When you spend enough time outside of your comfort zone, you get a new comfort zone.

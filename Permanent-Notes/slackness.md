**[Slackness (鬆弛；懈怠；不積極) - the absence of a binding constraint](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/09/30/slack/)**

* Slack means margin for error. You can relax.
* Slack allows pursuing opportunities. You can explore. You can trade.
* Slack prevents desperation. You can avoid bad trades and wait for better spots. You can be efficient.
* Slack permits planning for the long term. You can invest.
* Slack enables doing things for your own amusement. You can play games. You can have fun.
* Slack enables doing the right thing. Stand by your friends. Reward the worthy. Punish the wicked. You can have a code.
* Slack presents things as they are without concern for how things look or what others think. You can be honest.
* Slack in project management is the time a task can be delayed without causing a delay to either subsequent tasks or project completion time. The amount of time before a constraint binds. [^1]

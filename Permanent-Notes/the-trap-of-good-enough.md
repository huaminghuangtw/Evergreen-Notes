The reason most people never change is because they’re [too attached to who they’ve always been](be-ready-to-change-your-mind-completely-at-any-given-time.md).

The worst prison in the world is having the talent and intelligence to achieve something great but lacking the [courage](courage-is-knowing-what-not-to-fear.md) to go out and do it.

<mark>The worst thing in the world isn’t being on a bad path. The worst thing in the world is being on a good path that isn’t yours.</mark>

The bad path screams for change. The good path that isn’t yours sits in silence.

Reinvention takes courage. [^1] Reinvention starts with release. You can’t build a new life with old wiring. Letting go is the real first step.

Nothing changes if nothing changes. If you change nothing, nothing will change.

Change requires death: The death of old beliefs, old habits, old environments.

Reinvention has a cost of entry. Pay it with pride.

[^1]: 放棄，其實比堅持更難；因為放棄需要理由。

= 人生賽局

* Be carefully selective/picky in the games you choose to play. Which game you play is much more important than how well you play the game. Fight battles you are destined to win.
* Don't play games you don't want to win. If you play stupid games, you will win stupid prizes. [Escape the rat race cycle.](https://fs.blog/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/)
* Analogy: 夾娃娃機
	* 本體 (e.g., 機台造型、擺設方式)
	* 贈品 (e.g., 保夾金額、物品價值)

[@carseFiniteInfiniteGames2012]

* **出奇制勝**結束了**有限**遊戲；而**出乎意料**則是**無限**遊戲繼續進行的原因
* To be prepared against surprise is to be trained. To be prepared for surprise is to be educated. (準備應對驚喜，意味著接受訓練；準備迎接驚喜，意味著接受教育)
	* While training is essential for certain scenarios, education is more important for truly navigating the complexities and uncertainties of life
		* **Training**: A more rigid approach where you aim to minimize surprises by mastering specific skills or responses.
			* 訓練是在未來重複一個已經完成的過去
		* **Education**: A more dynamic, flexible approach that allows you to engage with and learn from surprises when they happen.
			* 教育是將未完成的過去延續到未來

# [The 2 Types of Status by Sahil Bloom](https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/the-2-types-of-status-bought-vs-earned)

| Earned Status Game | Bought Status Game |
| :---: | :---: |
| _Could the richest person in the world acquire the thing I want by tomorrow?_ | _Would I still be interested in buying (or doing/learning) this thing if I could not show it to anyone or tell anyone about it?_ |
| If the answer to this question is NO, you're playing an Earned Status Game. | If the answer to this question is NO, you're playing a Bought Status Game. |
| 要裡子 | 爭面子 |

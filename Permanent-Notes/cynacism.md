= 憤世忌俗

Rooted in a belief that the world or people are inherently flawed or corrupt.

Seeks to protect from disappointment by assuming the worst or believing the world operates through ulterior motives.

Feels good simply by portraying others as worse.

Many seek self-esteem not in their own abilities, but in other's failures.

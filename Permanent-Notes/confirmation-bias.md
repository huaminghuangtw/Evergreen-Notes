Confirmation bias (確認偏誤) is the tendency to search for, interpret, and remember information in a way that confirms our preconceptions.

* It shapes our worldview, making us more likely to notice evidence that supports what we already believe, while ignoring or dismissing contradictory information.
* It reinforces stereotypes (意識形態) and prejudices (歧視), making it harder to change our minds or learn from new experiences.

> Shoot the arrow, then draw the target.

illustrates how we often decide what we want to believe and then look for evidence to justify it, rather than letting evidence guide our beliefs.

[Understanding stress with a glass of water.](https://youtu.be/RGTfEfVcMqA)

---

The absolute weight of the glass doesn't matter. It depends on how long I hold onto it.
​
If I hold it for a minute, nothing happens. If I hold it for an hour, my arm will begin to ache. If I hold it all day long, my arm will feel numb and paralyzed.
​
Well, the weight of the glass hasn't changed, but the longer I hold onto it, the heavier it becomes.
The students lean in, and the professor continues with the deeper lesson:

The stresses and the worries of life are like this glass of water.
​
If you think about them for a little while, there's no problem. Think about it for a little bit longer, it begins to hurt. If you think about them all day long, you'll feel paralyzed, incapable of doing anything.
​
Always remember: Put the glass down.

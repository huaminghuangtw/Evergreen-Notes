The Trichotomy of Control adds some important nuance to this idea that we should only concern ourselves with things that are within our control.

The best solution is to use both together: Identify the few critical tasks that contribute most to income and schedule them with very short and clear deadlines.

Here are two truisms to keep in mind:

“I do what I always do: find a personal e-mail if possible, often through their little-known personal blogs, send a two to three-paragraph e-mail which explains that I am familiar with their work, and ask one simple-to-answer but thought-provoking question in that e-mail related to their work or life philosophies. The goal is to start a dialogue so they take the time to answer future e-mails—not to ask for help. That can only come after at least three or four genuine e-mail exchanges.”

Taurine helps regulate body temperature by increasing the rate at which sweat is produced, which is how the body cools itself.

The more your body heats up during a workout, the faster you fatigue. But if you could keep your body a little cooler, then you might be able to push harder or last longer during exercise.

Benefits are more important than features in marketing.

The Fosbury Flop

But time just gets more and more expensive. We start out as time fat cats and end up in time poverty. The older you get, the more it makes sense to spend money to save time.

People tend to get wealthier as they get older, which is like everything becoming cheaper as you age.

All progress, not only technological progress, is built on learning from past failures and mistakes. The museum aims to stimulate productive discussion about failure and inspire us to take meaningful risks.

In my experience, most people underestimate their full capability and overestimate their current delivery.

Robert Vallerand, who suggested that there are two distinct types of passion:

Obsessive Passion

Harmonious Passion

Obsessive Passion is rigid. Your entire identity becomes interconnected with the pursuit itself. Your self-worth attached to your extrinsic success in it. Rest periods away from the pursuit are viewed as a reward for your efforts, but often create feelings of guilt or shame. It is all-consuming.

The pursuit defines the life.

Harmonious Passion is adaptive. It is chosen. It aligns with your identity, but it does not supersede it. It is a reflection of your priorities and values. It is naturally energizing. Rest periods away from the pursuit are viewed as an important part of your performance, not a reward for your efforts.

The life defines the pursuit.

You are the cracked pot. Perfectly imperfect. Remember that. The Story of the Cracked Pot

There was an old man who lived in a village in India. Every morning, he would place a long stick across his back, hang a water pot from each end, and walk several miles to the river to get fresh water for his family.

But the two water pots were not the same. One had a series of small cracks in its side, causing it to leak.

The old man would fill both pots at the river, but by the time he got back to his home, the cracked pot would be half empty, the water having leaked out during the walk.

The cracked pot grew increasingly ashamed of its inability to complete the task for which it was made. One day, while the old man filled the two pots at the river, the cracked pot spoke to him.

“I’m sorry. I’m so embarrassed that I cannot fulfill my responsibilities as well as the other pot.”

The old man smiled and replied, “On the walk home today, rather than hanging your head in shame, I want you to look up at the side of the path.”

The cracked pot reluctantly agreed to do as the old man asked. As they left the riverbank and started on the path, he couldn’t believe his eyes.

On his side of the path was a beautiful row of flowers.

“You see,” the old man said, “I’ve always known you had those cracks, so I planted flower seeds along your side of the path. Each day, your cracks helped me water them. And now, I pick these flowers to share their beauty with the entire village.”

Running one mile has more in common with running a marathon than sitting at home.

Investing $100 has more in common with being a millionaire than being broke.

Writing one sentence has more in common with writing a book than never writing one.

It always feels small in the beginning and the big goals seem far away. It’s easy to talk yourself out of the early attempts because they feel kind of meaningless.

But every race starts with one step. Every fortune starts with a small deposit. Every book begins as one sentence.

‘Do not ask your children to strive’

by William Martin Do not ask your children

to strive for extraordinary lives. Such striving may seem admirable,

but it is the way of foolishness. Help them instead to find the wonder

and the marvel of an ordinary life. Show them the joy of tasting

tomatoes, apples and pears. Show them how to cry

when pets and people die. Show them the infinite pleasure

in the touch of a hand.

And make the ordinary come alive for them.

The extraordinary will take care of itself.

One day, a boy approached his father and asked, “What is my life worth?”

The father handed his son a small stone and replied, “Take this stone to the market. If anyone asks the price, raise two fingers and don’t say anything.”

The boy did as he was told and went to the market. An old woman approached him and asked, “How much is that rock? I want it for my garden.”

The boy held up two fingers, to which the woman replied, “$2? I’ll take it.”

Before she could complete the deal, the boy turned and ran home to tell his father what had happened.

His father nodded and said, “Ok, now take the stone to the museum. If anyone asks the price, raise two fingers and don’t say anything.”

The boy did as he was told and went to the museum. A man in a suit approached him and asked, “How much is that stone? I want it for my home.”

The boy held up two fingers, to which the man replied, “$200? I’ll take it.”

Before he could complete the deal, the boy turned and ran home to tell his father what had happened.

His father nodded and said, “Ok, now take the stone to the precious gem store. If the owner asks the price, raise two fingers and don’t say anything.”

The boy did as he was told and went to the stone store. The owner of the store approached him and asked, “Where did you find that rare stone? I have been looking for it my entire life. How much will you sell it for?”

The boy held up two fingers, to which the man replied, “$20,000? I’ll take it.”

But once again, before he could complete the deal, the boy turned and ran home to tell his father what had happened…

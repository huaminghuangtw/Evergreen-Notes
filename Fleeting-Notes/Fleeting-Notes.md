“Gratitude isn’t all about what’s going right. It’s about finding a little light in this moment we’re in.” — Mary Davis

In a 1998 commencement speech at Rice University, author Kurt Vonnegut shared a story about his Uncle Alex, who had an uncanny habit we can all learn from:

One thing which my Uncle Alex found objectionable about human beings was that they seldom took time out to notice when they were happy.

He himself did his best to acknowledge it when times were sweet. We could be drinking lemonade in the shade of an apple tree in the summertime, and he would interrupt the conversation to say, “If this isn’t nice, what is?”

So, I hope that you Adams and Eves in front of me will do the same for the rest of your lives. When things are going sweetly and peacefully, please pause a moment, and then say out loud:

“If this isn’t nice, what is?”

poem by Jean de La Fontaine that brings this idea to life:

How many folks, in country and in town,

Neglect their principal affair;

And let, for want of due repair,​

A real house fall down,

To build a castle in the air?

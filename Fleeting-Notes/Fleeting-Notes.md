Lao Tzu, the ancient Chinese philosopher, on the overlap between respect and self-alignment:

“When you are content to be simply yourself and don’t compare or compete, everybody will respect you.”

Source: Paraphrased from the Tao Te Ching. The original translation reads closer to something like, “Because he doesn’t compare himself with others, no one can compare with him.”

it’s almost impossible to beat someone who genuinely enjoys the work itself.

And when you find that thing—that game you genuinely enjoy—I’ll say the same thing I said about Tim:

Good luck to anyone trying to compete with you.

[Never try to compete against someone who is obsessed (like Kobe Bryant)](https://youtu.be/tqiMvVIwu1g)

樂在其中/走火入魔的人 \>\>\> 認真勤奮努力的人

# The Djokovic Rule: Do You Like Hitting The Ball?

In 2015, tennis legend Novak Djokovic was asked about the drivers of his exceptional on-court success.

His response was simple:

“I can carry on playing at this level because I like hitting the tennis ball.”

When the interviewer pressed him, asking whether there were players who don’t, he continued:

“There are people out there who don’t have the right motivation. I can see it. But I don’t judge.”

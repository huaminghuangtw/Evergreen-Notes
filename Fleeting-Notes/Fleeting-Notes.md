The Trichotomy of Control adds some important nuance to this idea that we should only concern ourselves with things that are within our control.

The best solution is to use both together: Identify the few critical tasks that contribute most to income and schedule them with very short and clear deadlines.

Here are two truisms to keep in mind:

“I do what I always do: find a personal e-mail if possible, often through their little-known personal blogs, send a two to three-paragraph e-mail which explains that I am familiar with their work, and ask one simple-to-answer but thought-provoking question in that e-mail related to their work or life philosophies. The goal is to start a dialogue so they take the time to answer future e-mails—not to ask for help. That can only come after at least three or four genuine e-mail exchanges.”

Taurine helps regulate body temperature by increasing the rate at which sweat is produced, which is how the body cools itself.

The more your body heats up during a workout, the faster you fatigue. But if you could keep your body a little cooler, then you might be able to push harder or last longer during exercise.

But time just gets more and more expensive. We start out as time fat cats and end up in time poverty. The older you get, the more it makes sense to spend money to save time.

People tend to get wealthier as they get older, which is like everything becoming cheaper as you age.

the power of tiny actions:

The Starfish Rule - An old man was walking along the beach when he noticed a young boy picking up starfish and throwing them back into the ocean.

Approaching the boy, he asked, “Excuse me, but what are you doing?”

The boy replied, “The sun is rising and the tide is going out. If I don’t throw the starfish back in, they’ll die.”

The old man shook his head and said, “But there’s too many starfish on this beach. You can’t possibly make a difference.”

After thinking for a moment, the boy bent down, picked up another starfish and threw it into the ocean.

Then, he turned to the old man and said, “Well, I made a difference to that one.”

* Adaptation of Loren Eiseley’s “Starfish Story” (1969)

The Stoic Archer

In On the Ends of Good and Evil, the ancient Stoic philosopher Cicero shares a beautiful metaphor of an archer shooting an arrow (emphasis mine):

“Take the case of one whose task it is to shoot a spear or arrow straight at some target. One’s ultimate aim is to do all in one’s power to shoot straight, and the same applies with our ultimate goal. In this kind of example, it is to shoot straight that one must do all one can; nonetheless, it is to do all one can to accomplish the task that is really the ultimate aim. It is just the same with what we call the supreme good in life. To actually hit the target is, as we say, to be selected but not sought.”

The metaphor offers a compelling visual with a powerful set of lessons for all of our lives.

You are the archer.

[“He’s not perfect. You aren’t either, and the two of you will never be perfect. But if he can make you laugh at least once, causes you to think twice, and if he admits to being human and making mistakes, hold onto him and give him the most you can. He isn’t going to quote poetry, he’s not thinking about you every moment, but he will give you a part of him that he knows you could break. Don’t hurt him, don’t change him, and don’t expect for more than he can give. Don’t analyze. Smile when he makes you happy, yell when he makes you mad, and miss him when he’s not there. Love hard when there is love to be had. Because perfect guys don’t exist, but there’s always one guy that is perfect for you.” — Bob Marley](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/361858-he-s-not-perfect-you-aren-t-either-and-the-two-of)

Only when habits of order are formed can we advance to really interesting fields of action—and consequently accumulate grain on grain of wilful choice like a very miser—never forgetting how one link dropped undoes an indefinite number. The more of the details of our daily life we can hand over to the effortless custody of automatism, the more our higher powers of mind will be set free for their own proper work. There is no more miserable human being than one in whom nothing is habitual but indecision, and for whom the lighting of every cigar, the drinking of every cup, the time of rising and going to bed every day, and the beginning of every bit of work, are subjects of express volitional deliberation.

“Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.” — Aristotle

---

Robert Vallerand, who suggested that there are two distinct types of passion:

Obsessive Passion

Harmonious Passion

Obsessive Passion is rigid. Your entire identity becomes interconnected with the pursuit itself. Your self-worth attached to your extrinsic success in it. Rest periods away from the pursuit are viewed as a reward for your efforts, but often create feelings of guilt or shame. It is all-consuming.

The pursuit defines the life.

Harmonious Passion is adaptive. It is chosen. It aligns with your identity, but it does not supersede it. It is a reflection of your priorities and values. It is naturally energizing. Rest periods away from the pursuit are viewed as an important part of your performance, not a reward for your efforts.

The life defines the pursuit.

You are the cracked pot. Perfectly imperfect. Remember that. The Story of the Cracked Pot

There was an old man who lived in a village in India. Every morning, he would place a long stick across his back, hang a water pot from each end, and walk several miles to the river to get fresh water for his family.

But the two water pots were not the same. One had a series of small cracks in its side, causing it to leak.

The old man would fill both pots at the river, but by the time he got back to his home, the cracked pot would be half empty, the water having leaked out during the walk.

The cracked pot grew increasingly ashamed of its inability to complete the task for which it was made. One day, while the old man filled the two pots at the river, the cracked pot spoke to him.

“I’m sorry. I’m so embarrassed that I cannot fulfill my responsibilities as well as the other pot.”

The old man smiled and replied, “On the walk home today, rather than hanging your head in shame, I want you to look up at the side of the path.”

The cracked pot reluctantly agreed to do as the old man asked. As they left the riverbank and started on the path, he couldn’t believe his eyes.

On his side of the path was a beautiful row of flowers.

“You see,” the old man said, “I’ve always known you had those cracks, so I planted flower seeds along your side of the path. Each day, your cracks helped me water them. And now, I pick these flowers to share their beauty with the entire village.”

Running one mile has more in common with running a marathon than sitting at home.

Investing $100 has more in common with being a millionaire than being broke.

Writing one sentence has more in common with writing a book than never writing one.

But every race starts with one step. Every fortune starts with a small deposit. Every book begins as one sentence.

‘Do not ask your children to strive’

by William Martin Do not ask your children

to strive for extraordinary lives. Such striving may seem admirable,

but it is the way of foolishness. Help them instead to find the wonder

and the marvel of an ordinary life. Show them the joy of tasting

tomatoes, apples and pears. Show them how to cry

when pets and people die. Show them the infinite pleasure

in the touch of a hand.

And make the ordinary come alive for them.

The extraordinary will take care of itself.

The Trichotomy of Control adds some important nuance to this idea that we should only concern ourselves with things that are within our control.

The best solution is to use both together: Identify the few critical tasks that contribute most to income and schedule them with very short and clear deadlines.

Here are two truisms to keep in mind:

“I do what I always do: find a personal e-mail if possible, often through their little-known personal blogs, send a two to three-paragraph e-mail which explains that I am familiar with their work, and ask one simple-to-answer but thought-provoking question in that e-mail related to their work or life philosophies. The goal is to start a dialogue so they take the time to answer future e-mails—not to ask for help. That can only come after at least three or four genuine e-mail exchanges.”

Taurine helps regulate body temperature by increasing the rate at which sweat is produced, which is how the body cools itself.

The more your body heats up during a workout, the faster you fatigue. But if you could keep your body a little cooler, then you might be able to push harder or last longer during exercise.

Benefits are more important than features in marketing.

* Make people want the benefits before telling them about what they get.
* Focus on how their life changes and the overall benefit extension.
* Features can be discussed after emphasizing the benefits.

‘Do not ask your children to strive’

by William Martin Do not ask your children

to strive for extraordinary lives. Such striving may seem admirable,

but it is the way of foolishness. Help them instead to find the wonder

and the marvel of an ordinary life. Show them the joy of tasting

tomatoes, apples and pears. Show them how to cry

when pets and people die. Show them the infinite pleasure

in the touch of a hand.

And make the ordinary come alive for them.

The extraordinary will take care of itself.

One day, a boy approached his father and asked, “What is my life worth?”

The father handed his son a small stone and replied, “Take this stone to the market. If anyone asks the price, raise two fingers and don’t say anything.”

The boy did as he was told and went to the market. An old woman approached him and asked, “How much is that rock? I want it for my garden.”

The boy held up two fingers, to which the woman replied, “$2? I’ll take it.”

Before she could complete the deal, the boy turned and ran home to tell his father what had happened.

His father nodded and said, “Ok, now take the stone to the museum. If anyone asks the price, raise two fingers and don’t say anything.”

The boy did as he was told and went to the museum. A man in a suit approached him and asked, “How much is that stone? I want it for my home.”

The boy held up two fingers, to which the man replied, “$200? I’ll take it.”

Before he could complete the deal, the boy turned and ran home to tell his father what had happened.

His father nodded and said, “Ok, now take the stone to the precious gem store. If the owner asks the price, raise two fingers and don’t say anything.”

The boy did as he was told and went to the stone store. The owner of the store approached him and asked, “Where did you find that rare stone? I have been looking for it my entire life. How much will you sell it for?”

The boy held up two fingers, to which the man replied, “$20,000? I’ll take it.”

But once again, before he could complete the deal, the boy turned and ran home to tell his father what had happened…

The approach suggests celebrating twice as often as setting new goals.

Instead of the outdated ‘criticism sandwich (criticize twice, praise once)’ method, where criticism is sandwiched between two praises within 30 seconds, it is advised to provide two praises at different times during the day and one criticism, as well as two thank-yous and one private criticism throughout the week.

It is much more important to work on the right thing than it is to work many hours. Most people waste most of their time on stuff that doesn’t matter.

The Trichotomy of Control adds some important nuance to this idea that we should only concern ourselves with things that are within our control.

This presents a very curious phenomenon. There are two synergistic approaches for increasing productivity that are inversions of each other:

1. Limit tasks to the important to shorten work time (80/20).
2. Shorten work time to limit tasks to the important (Parkin-son’s Law).
The best solution is to use both together: Identify the few critical tasks that contribute most to income and schedule them with very short and clear deadlines.
Slow down and remember this: Most things make no difference.
Being busy is a form of laziness—lazy thinking and indiscriminate action.
Being overwhelmed is often as unproductive as doing nothing, and is far more unpleasant. Being selective —doing less— is the path of the productive. Focus on the important few and ignore the rest.
3. Doing something unimportant well does not make it impor tant.
4. Requiring a lot of time does not make a task important.
From this moment forward, remember this: What you do is infinitely more important than how you do it. Efficiency is still impor-tant, but it is useless unless applied to the right things.
Being Effective vs. Being Efficient

I would consider the best door-to-door salesperson efficient— that is, refined and excellent at selling door-to-door without wasting time—but utterly ineffective. He or she would sell more using a better vehicle such as e-mail or direct mail.
This is also true for the person who checks e-mail 3o times per day and develops an elaborate system of folder rules and sophisticated techniques for ensuring that each of those 3o brain farts moves as quickly as possible. I was a specialist at such professional wheel-spinning. It is efficient on some perverse level, but far from effective.
Here are two truisms to keep in mind:
“I do what I always do: find a personal e-mail if possible, often through their little-known personal blogs, send a twoto three-paragraph e-mail which explains that I am familiar with their work, and ask one simple-to-answer but thought-provoking question in that e-mail related to their work or life philosophies. The goal is to start a dialogue so they take the time to answer future e-mails—not to ask for help. That can only come after at least three or four genuine e-mail exchanges.”

The point is to be mindful of cultivating both a mixture of activities that require effort to derive pleasure and also seeking contentment from what you have, and to realize that anything that quickly spikes dopamine without effort is likely to be destructive in the long run

The important thing to understand about dopamine is that the faster and higher it goes, the lower and longer it drops below baseline afterwards.

In order to keep the reward systems of your brain working for you instead of against you, it can be wise to avoid things that lead to big dopamine increases without much effort.

Nearing the end of a long journey, a young Buddhist comes to the banks of a deep, wide river. He doesn’t know how to cross it and begins to ponder the challenge.

After several hours, he sees a Zen master on the other side of the river and calls out to him:

“Oh wise one, can you tell me how to cross this river and get to the other side?”

The Zen master thinks for a few moments and then replies:

“My son, you are on the other side.”

The Chinese bamboo tree can grow to be nearly 100 feet tall—but it’s how it achieves that growth that makes it even more interesting.

After being planted in the ground, it requires daily watering and nurturing.

And then, nothing happens: Despite the effort, days, weeks, months, and even years go by with no signs of any growth.

Two years, three years, four years pass, with continued daily inputs and not so much as a break in the surface to show for it.

But suddenly, in the fifth year, everything changes:

The Chinese bamboo tree breaks through the surface, and in the span of just six weeks, grows up to 90-feet-tall.

“A big reason guys get stuck in the [development league] is because they don’t realize the position they’re trying out for. It’s like going to a job interview thinking you’re going to be the CFO of the company and they’re looking for someone to clean the bathrooms…it’s a self-awareness of understanding what you’re good at, what teams need, and trying to do that.”

When asked about how he rose from undrafted nobody to this level of stardom, he said that self-awareness was the key:

You may think your attention has fully shifted to the new task, but your brain has a lag.

In other words, there is a cognitive switching cost to shifting your attention from one task to another. When your attention is shifted, there is a “residue” that remains with the prior task and impairs your cognitive performance on the new task.

In the original paper, Dr. Leroy defines attention residue as, “the persistence of cognitive activity about a Task A even though one stopped working on Task A and currently performs a Task B.”

How to say NO with grace and style?

* General Principle: Don’t lie. People value honesty.—Just say “I don’t feel like doing X. / I don’t want to do X. (And I don’t have to offer you an excuse and no should be a sufficient enough answer.)”
* The awkward pause: just pause, raise an eyebrow, and look at them in silence—Oftentimes when you tell someone you can’t do x because of y, people will give you all kinds of suggestions of how to cancel/postpone x and do y instead. People will try to “solve” the problem of why you can’t do something because they see what they want you to do as more important than what’s already on your agenda3. Say it with humor
* The soft “no” (“no but”, “thank you but”)
* Use e-mail bounce backs (like the auto response when someone is out of the office)
* “Let me check my calendar and get back to you.”
* “Sounds very interesting, but I will pass it at the moment”
* “Yes, but what should I deprioritize?”
* “You are welcome to X. I am willing to Y.”
* “I can’t do it, but X might be interested.”
* “I don’t have any synchronous time available, but I’m happy to connect by email.”
* “I’m supposed to do that.”
* Say no quickly as a way of kindness: If you have to (or want to) say no to something, do it immediately. → This gives the asker maximum time to find alternatives!
* Sounds nice, but I am not available.
* I am honored that you asked me, but I can’t do it.
* I’m sorry, but I can’t help you at this time.
* Unfortunately, it’s not a good time.
* I am not available at the moment, but maybe next time.
* Unfortunately, this is not something I can do right now.
* I really appreciate you asking me, but I can’t commit to that right now.
* Sorry, but I can’t make it; maybe another time.
* Thanks for thinking of me, but I can’t.
* No, thanks.

The Theory of Constraints is a business philosophy first proposed by Eliyahu Goldratt in his 1984 book, The Goal.

The key idea is that every system has at least one constraint that restricts its ability to grow or meaningfully improve its desired output.

In other words, there is a bottleneck that prevents the system from improving.

By focusing attention on improving the constraint—eliminating the bottleneck—you can dramatically improve the performance of the entire system.

The huge animals were clearly capable of breaking the rope.

Confused, she asked one of the keepers why the elephants didn’t break the ropes and wander off.

“Well, when the elephants were very young, we used the same small rope, but at that age, it was strong enough to hold them. Now, even though they are much bigger, they still believe the rope can hold them, so they never try to break it.”

Kinetic energy is potential energy in action

A martial arts student approaches his teacher and asks, “How long will it take me to master this craft?”

The teacher replies, “10 years.”

The student, looking impatient, responds, “I want to master it faster than that. I will work harder than anyone else. I will push myself to practice for many hours every single day. I won’t rest until I become a master. How long will it take then?”

The teacher considers this new information, smiles, and answers, “20 years.”

Microsoft’s Human Factors Lab studied 14 participants across two days of video meetings, with Day 1 comprised of four back-to-back 30-minute meetings and Day 2 comprised of four 30-minute meetings with 10-minute breaks in between. The researchers found that the breaks increased performance significantly (as measured by frontal alpha symmetry, a brain state connected to levels of engagement).

Back in the Vietnam days, soldiers in Vietnam had access to almost any narcotic they wanted from local friendly Vietnamese. A great many got quite seriously addicted to opiates like morphine. But then they came home, and for the most part they just stopped using morphine on their own. Few became addicts.

Of course scientists couldn’t figure out why, as morphine is powerfully addictive. There were many experiments on addiction using rats in cages, none of which explained how easily the soldiers gave up morphine. The result was always the sameget the rat addicted to morphine, and stayed addicted. Take away the morphine and the rat goes into withdrawal and flips out.

Anyway a scientist named Bruce Alexander hypothesized that maybe the problem with the experiment wasn’t the morphine, it was the cage. So they built a ‘cage’ called Rat Park200 times the size of a standard laboratory cage, containing 15-20 rats of both sexes, plenty of food, wheels, toys, other stimulation, and space for mating. Basicallyas close to rat paradise as you could get in a laboratory.

The most interesting part of the experiment went as followsa bunch of rats were addicted to morphine by giving them water with morphine mixed in it. Half of them were then put in standard lab cages, with two water dispensersone dispensing clean water, the other dispensing morphine-laced water. The other half were put in Rat Park, with the same two water dispensers.

The rats in lab cages would only drink the morphine water. However the rats in Rat Park quickly switched back to clean water, only rarely testing the morphine water.

The conclusion was simple-- when life sucks, addiction has a much more powerful hold. When life is fun and fulfilling, addiction is easier to beat.

The old man shook his head and said, “But there’s too many starfish on this beach. You can’t possibly make a difference.”

After thinking for a moment, the boy bent down, picked up another starfish and threw it into the ocean.

Then, he turned to the old man and said, “Well, I made a difference to that one.”

The Stoic Archer

In On the Ends of Good and Evil, the ancient Stoic philosopher Cicero shares a beautiful metaphor of an archer shooting an arrow (emphasis mine):

“Take the case of one whose task it is to shoot a spear or arrow straight at some target. One’s ultimate aim is to do all in one’s power to shoot straight, and the same applies with our ultimate goal. In this kind of example, it is to shoot straight that one must do all one can; nonetheless, it is to do all one can to accomplish the task that is really the ultimate aim. It is just the same with what we call the supreme good in life. To actually hit the target is, as we say, to be selected but not sought.”

The metaphor offers a compelling visual with a powerful set of lessons for all of our lives.

You are the archer.

Your focus should be centered on that which is within your control:

High agency people ask, “How could I make this possible?”

Preparation Always

Beats Planning.

[“He’s not perfect. You aren’t either, and the two of you will never be perfect. But if he can make you laugh at least once, causes you to think twice, and if he admits to being human and making mistakes, hold onto him and give him the most you can. He isn’t going to quote poetry, he’s not thinking about you every moment, but he will give you a part of him that he knows you could break. Don’t hurt him, don’t change him, and don’t expect for more than he can give. Don’t analyze. Smile when he makes you happy, yell when he makes you mad, and miss him when he’s not there. Love hard when there is love to be had. Because perfect guys don’t exist, but there’s always one guy that is perfect for you.” — Bob Marley](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/361858-he-s-not-perfect-you-aren-t-either-and-the-two-of)

Only when habits of order are formed can we advance to really interesting fields of action—and consequently accumulate grain on grain of wilful choice like a very miser—never forgetting how one link dropped undoes an indefinite number. The more of the details of our daily life we can hand over to the effortless custody of automatism, the more our higher powers of mind will be set free for their own proper work. There is no more miserable human being than one in whom nothing is habitual but indecision, and for whom the lighting of every cigar, the drinking of every cup, the time of rising and going to bed every day, and the beginning of every bit of work, are subjects of express volitional deliberation.

When I get to my 2nd or 3rd workout, I find myself wanting to exercise more. When I miss 2 to 3 workouts I find myself wanting to do nothing instead. It’s all about momentum.

When you plan excitement in advance, the return on that moment compounds. You don’t just enjoy it when it happens, you get the anticipation dividends too.

“Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.” — Aristotle

Robert Vallerand, who suggested that there are two distinct types of passion:

Obsessive Passion

Harmonious Passion

Obsessive Passion is rigid. Your entire identity becomes interconnected with the pursuit itself. Your self-worth attached to your extrinsic success in it. Rest periods away from the pursuit are viewed as a reward for your efforts, but often create feelings of guilt or shame. It is all-consuming.

The pursuit defines the life.

Harmonious Passion is adaptive. It is chosen. It aligns with your identity, but it does not supersede it. It is a reflection of your priorities and values. It is naturally energizing. Rest periods away from the pursuit are viewed as an important part of your performance, not a reward for your efforts.

The life defines the pursuit.

You are the cracked pot. Perfectly imperfect. Remember that. The Story of the Cracked Pot

There was an old man who lived in a village in India. Every morning, he would place a long stick across his back, hang a water pot from each end, and walk several miles to the river to get fresh water for his family.

But the two water pots were not the same. One had a series of small cracks in its side, causing it to leak.

The old man would fill both pots at the river, but by the time he got back to his home, the cracked pot would be half empty, the water having leaked out during the walk.

The cracked pot grew increasingly ashamed of its inability to complete the task for which it was made. One day, while the old man filled the two pots at the river, the cracked pot spoke to him.

“I’m sorry. I’m so embarrassed that I cannot fulfill my responsibilities as well as the other pot.”

The old man smiled and replied, “On the walk home today, rather than hanging your head in shame, I want you to look up at the side of the path.”

The cracked pot reluctantly agreed to do as the old man asked. As they left the riverbank and started on the path, he couldn’t believe his eyes.

On his side of the path was a beautiful row of flowers.

“You see,” the old man said, “I’ve always known you had those cracks, so I planted flower seeds along your side of the path. Each day, your cracks helped me water them. And now, I pick these flowers to share their beauty with the entire village.”

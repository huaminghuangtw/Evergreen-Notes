The Trichotomy of Control adds some important nuance to this idea that we should only concern ourselves with things that are within our control.

The best solution is to use both together: Identify the few critical tasks that contribute most to income and schedule them with very short and clear deadlines.

Here are two truisms to keep in mind:

“I do what I always do: find a personal e-mail if possible, often through their little-known personal blogs, send a two to three-paragraph e-mail which explains that I am familiar with their work, and ask one simple-to-answer but thought-provoking question in that e-mail related to their work or life philosophies. The goal is to start a dialogue so they take the time to answer future e-mails—not to ask for help. That can only come after at least three or four genuine e-mail exchanges.”

The more your body heats up during a workout, the faster you fatigue. But if you could keep your body a little cooler, then you might be able to push harder or last longer during exercise.

“A big reason guys get stuck in the [development league] is because they don’t realize the position they’re trying out for. It’s like going to a job interview thinking you’re going to be the CFO of the company and they’re looking for someone to clean the bathrooms…it’s a self-awareness of understanding what you’re good at, what teams need, and trying to do that.”

When asked about how he rose from undrafted nobody to this level of stardom, he said that self-awareness was the key:

Professional tennis is a Winner’s Game: 80% of points are won on incredible shots. You win by hitting incredible shots.

Amateur tennis is a Loser’s Game: 80% of points are lost on unforced errors. You win by avoiding errors and waiting for your opponent to make errors.

In the 1999 tennis book, Extraordinary Tennis for the Ordinary Tennis Player, author Simon Ramo broke down the difference between amateur and professional tennis, writing that they were two different types of games:

The Theory of Constraints is a business philosophy first proposed by Eliyahu Goldratt in his 1984 book, The Goal.

The key idea is that every system has at least one constraint that restricts its ability to grow or meaningfully improve its desired output.

In other words, there is a bottleneck that prevents the system from improving.

By focusing attention on improving the constraint—eliminating the bottleneck—you can dramatically improve the performance of the entire system.

Falling vs Growing in Love

While walking through an elephant camp, a woman noticed that the elephants were only being secured by a small rope around one ankle.

The huge animals were clearly capable of breaking the rope.

Confused, she asked one of the keepers why the elephants didn’t break the ropes and wander off.

“Well, when the elephants were very young, we used the same small rope, but at that age, it was strong enough to hold them. Now, even though they are much bigger, they still believe the rope can hold them, so they never try to break it.”

Kinetic energy is potential energy in action

A martial arts student approaches his teacher and asks, “How long will it take me to master this craft?”

The teacher replies, “10 years.”

The student, looking impatient, responds, “I want to master it faster than that. I will work harder than anyone else. I will push myself to practice for many hours every single day. I won’t rest until I become a master. How long will it take then?”

The teacher considers this new information, smiles, and answers, “20 years.”

Microsoft’s Human Factors Lab studied 14 participants across two days of video meetings, with Day 1 comprised of four back-to-back 30-minute meetings and Day 2 comprised of four 30-minute meetings with 10-minute breaks in between. The researchers found that the breaks increased performance significantly (as measured by frontal alpha symmetry, a brain state connected to levels of engagement).

Back in the Vietnam days, soldiers in Vietnam had access to almost any narcotic they wanted from local friendly Vietnamese. A great many got quite seriously addicted to opiates like morphine. But then they came home, and for the most part they just stopped using morphine on their own. Few became addicts.

Of course scientists couldn’t figure out why, as morphine is powerfully addictive. There were many experiments on addiction using rats in cages, none of which explained how easily the soldiers gave up morphine. The result was always the sameget the rat addicted to morphine, and stayed addicted. Take away the morphine and the rat goes into withdrawal and flips out.

Anyway a scientist named Bruce Alexander hypothesized that maybe the problem with the experiment wasn’t the morphine, it was the cage. So they built a ‘cage’ called Rat Park200 times the size of a standard laboratory cage, containing 15-20 rats of both sexes, plenty of food, wheels, toys, other stimulation, and space for mating. Basicallyas close to rat paradise as you could get in a laboratory.

The most interesting part of the experiment went as followsa bunch of rats were addicted to morphine by giving them water with morphine mixed in it. Half of them were then put in standard lab cages, with two water dispensersone dispensing clean water, the other dispensing morphine-laced water. The other half were put in Rat Park, with the same two water dispensers.

The rats in lab cages would only drink the morphine water. However the rats in Rat Park quickly switched back to clean water, only rarely testing the morphine water.

The conclusion was simple-- when life sucks, addiction has a much more powerful hold. When life is fun and fulfilling, addiction is easier to beat.

Pay close attention to the stories you tell yourself, because stories create your reality.

---

The Narrative Fallacy is the tendency to craft a story around data, events, and inputs. Basically, our brains like to “make sense” of the random chaos around us, so the stories provide that structure—they provide a sense of calm.

Therefore, the original stories are often the ones that gets preserved and deeply entrenched:

New information is massaged to fit that story, or rejected if it doesn’t.

OVER-RELIANCE ON THE HEAD Another way of putting it is like this: learn to listen to your gut and start trusting it a bit more. In the West, we have a head-driven culture, where we think we can explain and rationalize everything with our minds. We ignore the fact that some of the deepest intelligence we have, as humans, is located deep within our bodies.

The Starfish Rule - An old man was walking along the beach when he noticed a young boy picking up starfish and throwing them back into the ocean.

Approaching the boy, he asked, “Excuse me, but what are you doing?”

The boy replied, “The sun is rising and the tide is going out. If I don’t throw the starfish back in, they’ll die.”

The old man shook his head and said, “But there’s too many starfish on this beach. You can’t possibly make a difference.”

After thinking for a moment, the boy bent down, picked up another starfish and threw it into the ocean.

Then, he turned to the old man and said, “Well, I made a difference to that one.”

Instead, every detail is magnified. Every punch is slow-motion.

The Stoic Archer

In On the Ends of Good and Evil, the ancient Stoic philosopher Cicero shares a beautiful metaphor of an archer shooting an arrow (emphasis mine):

“Take the case of one whose task it is to shoot a spear or arrow straight at some target. One’s ultimate aim is to do all in one’s power to shoot straight, and the same applies with our ultimate goal. In this kind of example, it is to shoot straight that one must do all one can; nonetheless, it is to do all one can to accomplish the task that is really the ultimate aim. It is just the same with what we call the supreme good in life. To actually hit the target is, as we say, to be selected but not sought.”

The metaphor offers a compelling visual with a powerful set of lessons for all of our lives.

You are the archer.

Only when habits of order are formed can we advance to really interesting fields of action—and consequently accumulate grain on grain of wilful choice like a very miser—never forgetting how one link dropped undoes an indefinite number. The more of the details of our daily life we can hand over to the effortless custody of automatism, the more our higher powers of mind will be set free for their own proper work. There is no more miserable human being than one in whom nothing is habitual but indecision, and for whom the lighting of every cigar, the drinking of every cup, the time of rising and going to bed every day, and the beginning of every bit of work, are subjects of express volitional deliberation.

“Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.” — Aristotle

---

Robert Vallerand, who suggested that there are two distinct types of passion:

Obsessive Passion

Harmonious Passion

Obsessive Passion is rigid. Your entire identity becomes interconnected with the pursuit itself. Your self-worth attached to your extrinsic success in it. Rest periods away from the pursuit are viewed as a reward for your efforts, but often create feelings of guilt or shame. It is all-consuming.

The pursuit defines the life.

Harmonious Passion is adaptive. It is chosen. It aligns with your identity, but it does not supersede it. It is a reflection of your priorities and values. It is naturally energizing. Rest periods away from the pursuit are viewed as an important part of your performance, not a reward for your efforts.

The life defines the pursuit.

You are the cracked pot. Perfectly imperfect. Remember that. The Story of the Cracked Pot

There was an old man who lived in a village in India. Every morning, he would place a long stick across his back, hang a water pot from each end, and walk several miles to the river to get fresh water for his family.

But the two water pots were not the same. One had a series of small cracks in its side, causing it to leak.

The old man would fill both pots at the river, but by the time he got back to his home, the cracked pot would be half empty, the water having leaked out during the walk.

The cracked pot grew increasingly ashamed of its inability to complete the task for which it was made. One day, while the old man filled the two pots at the river, the cracked pot spoke to him.

“I’m sorry. I’m so embarrassed that I cannot fulfill my responsibilities as well as the other pot.”

The old man smiled and replied, “On the walk home today, rather than hanging your head in shame, I want you to look up at the side of the path.”

The cracked pot reluctantly agreed to do as the old man asked. As they left the riverbank and started on the path, he couldn’t believe his eyes.

On his side of the path was a beautiful row of flowers.

“You see,” the old man said, “I’ve always known you had those cracks, so I planted flower seeds along your side of the path. Each day, your cracks helped me water them. And now, I pick these flowers to share their beauty with the entire village.”

‘Do not ask your children to strive’

by William Martin Do not ask your children

to strive for extraordinary lives. Such striving may seem admirable,

but it is the way of foolishness. Help them instead to find the wonder

and the marvel of an ordinary life. Show them the joy of tasting

tomatoes, apples and pears. Show them how to cry

when pets and people die. Show them the infinite pleasure

in the touch of a hand.

And make the ordinary come alive for them.

The extraordinary will take care of itself.

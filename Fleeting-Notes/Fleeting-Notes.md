Lao Tzu, the ancient Chinese philosopher, on the overlap between respect and self-alignment:

“When you are content to be simply yourself and don’t compare or compete, everybody will respect you.”

Source: Paraphrased from the Tao Te Ching. The original translation reads closer to something like, “Because he doesn’t compare himself with others, no one can compare with him.”

it’s almost impossible to beat someone who genuinely enjoys the work itself.

And when you find that thing—that game you genuinely enjoy—I’ll say the same thing I said about Tim:

Good luck to anyone trying to compete with you.

[Never try to compete against someone who is obsessed (like Kobe Bryant)](https://youtu.be/tqiMvVIwu1g)

# The Djokovic Rule: Do You Like Hitting The Ball?

In 2015, tennis legend Novak Djokovic was asked about the drivers of his exceptional on-court success.

His response was simple:

“I can carry on playing at this level because I like hitting the tennis ball.”

When the interviewer pressed him, asking whether there were players who don’t, he continued:

“There are people out there who don’t have the right motivation. I can see it. But I don’t judge.”

James Clear (author of Atomic Habits):

I think about decisions in three ways: hats, haircuts, and tattoos.

Most decisions are like hats. Try one and if you don’t like it, put it back and try another. The cost of a mistake is low, so move quickly and try a bunch of hats.

Some decisions are like haircuts. You can fix a bad one, but it won’t be quick and you might feel foolish for a while. That said, don’t be scared of a bad haircut. Trying something new is usually a risk worth taking. If it doesn’t work out, by this time next year you will have moved on and so will everyone else.

A few decisions are like tattoos. Once you make them, you have to live with them. Some mistakes are irreversible. Maybe you’ll move on for a moment, but then you’ll glance in the mirror and be reminded of that choice all over again. Even years later, the decision leaves a mark. When you’re dealing with an irreversible choice, move slowly and think carefully.

My rules for embracing first pass thinking:
I think before I prompt. I clarify the problem, my perspective, and what I actually believe before asking a machine to weigh in.
I write before I refine. I force myself to produce a bad first draft before touching any tools.
I decide before I optimize. I form an initial core judgement by myself, then use tools to pressure-test or improve it.

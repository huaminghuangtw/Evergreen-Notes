One day, a boy approached his father and asked, “What is my life worth?”

The father handed his son a small stone and replied, “Take this stone to the market. If anyone asks the price, raise two fingers and don’t say anything.”

The boy did as he was told and went to the market. An old woman approached him and asked, “How much is that rock? I want it for my garden.”

The boy held up two fingers, to which the woman replied, “$2? I’ll take it.”

Before she could complete the deal, the boy turned and ran home to tell his father what had happened.

His father nodded and said, “Ok, now take the stone to the museum. If anyone asks the price, raise two fingers and don’t say anything.”

The boy held up two fingers, to which the man replied, “$200? I’ll take it.”

Before he could complete the deal, the boy turned and ran home to tell his father what had happened.

His father nodded and said, “Ok, now take the stone to the precious gem store. If the owner asks the price, raise two fingers and don’t say anything.”

The boy did as he was told and went to the stone store. The owner of the store approached him and asked, “Where did you find that rare stone? I have been looking for it my entire life. How much will you sell it for?”

The boy held up two fingers, to which the man replied, “$20,000? I’ll take it.”

But once again, before he could complete the deal, the boy turned and ran home to tell his father what had happened…
